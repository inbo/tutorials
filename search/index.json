[{"content":"Introduction Welcome to the tutorials website of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO). It contains a collection of guides, tutorials and further reading material on the installation, use and development of (research) software at our institute.\nGetting started When this is your first time checking this website, welcome! If you are looking for something specific, the website provides 3 options to search for relevant topics:\n Categories: A (limited) set of general categories to classify the tutorials. For example, installation for support during installation of software or r for tutorials about the R programming language. Click on a category to get the relevant tutorials. Tags: Check the cloud of tags listed on each page of the website and pick an item that would be relevant for your topic. By clicking on a specific tag, you will get an overview of the tutorials with this tag. Search: Type any word in the search form and you will get a dropdown list of the pages which contain the word you are looking for.  Website menu In addition to the navigation options explained in the previous section, pages are divided into 3 main section accessible in the menu:\n Tutorials: The main bulk of pages, providing tutorials on a variety of topics. Articles: Provides useful background information about topics, links to literature, etc. Installation: Installation instructions for both system administrators and users.  The absence of a more granular menu is a deliberate decision to overcome the requirement to recreate a website menu when new tutorials are written. By using categories and tags, more flexibility is provided. The tags list, categories overview and search options are automatically updated when a new tutorial is added to the website.\nWant to contribute? Great news! By sharing information, we can effectively help each other. Moreover, a tutorial is useful for your future self as well ;-). Discovered something that could be useful to your colleagues? Instead of keeping a note or document on your own computer or drive, make it a tutorial and share it. Note that links/references to other resources are also useful to add, as this will enable others to find these resources.\nCheck the create tutorial page for more information on how to contribute to this website!\nTechnical information can be found in the Readme of the code repository.\nQuestions? If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the website maintainers (main contributors listed here), create a new issue if you already have a GitHub account or email the IT helpdesk for more information.\n","href":"/tutorials/","title":"Home"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/articles/","title":"Articles"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials"},{"content":"Introduction First of all, thanks to consider making a new tutorial! By providing a tutorial, you are actively supporting your colleagues and the wider community and making work more efficient.\nIn this page, the roadmap towards a new tutorial will be explained.\nWriting a tutorial Each tutorial is setup in a subfolder of the content/tutorials folder. Within this folder, different files and formats may exist as you create them, but a file with the name index.md will be used for the tutorials website. So, you can create the tutorial directly in markdown or create it based on a Rmarkdown, a Jupyter notebook or any other format, as long as there is a single markdown file with the name index.md in your tutorial folder.\nThere are different ways to create this file. We will provide in this document specific instructions for markdown an Rmarkdown based tutorials. Still, if you got useful information or text in another format or you got stuck with the description, do not hesitate to describe your submission in a new issue . If you do not have a Github account, ask the IT helpdesk. We will try to support you as soon as possible.\n1. writing a markdown tutorial If you are directly writing your documentation in markdown syntax, you can either work online using Github or work on your own computer while using git.\nOnline submission Although providing less functionalities (adding custom images is not directly supported), the Github interface provides already a powerfull interface to add new content.\nTo write a new tutorial online, go to the INBO-tutorials Github repository and navigate to the /content/tutorials page, or use this link.\nNext, click the Create new file button\nYou will be directed to a new page and asked to Name your file\u0026hellip;\nProviding this name is very important, so make sure:\n provide a folder name + / + index.md the folder name needs to be all lowercase the folder name should not have spaces, but you can use _ to separate words provide a meaningful name without dates or names  For example: r_tidy_data/index.md, database_query_inboveg/index.md or statistics_regression/index.md\nNotice: The moment you type the /, Github will guide you by translating this to a folder name.\nNext, in the edit field you can start typing your tutorial. The header has an agreed format and you should copy paste this to start with:\n--- title: \u0026quot;YOUR TITLE\u0026quot; description: \u0026quot;SHORT DESCRIPTION ON TUTORIAL\u0026quot; authors: [YOUR_AUTHOR_ID] date: YYYY-MM-DD categories: [\u0026quot;YOUR_CATEGORY\u0026quot;] tags: [\u0026quot;FIRST_TAG\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SECOND_TAG\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;] --- # your text starts here... Replace all the CAPITAL words with appropriate information:\n a short clear title a single or two line description your author id: for each author on INBO tutorials, there\u0026rsquo;s a AUTHOR_ID.toml file under data/authors. If it\u0026rsquo;s your first contribution, please choose an author id (suggestion: your full name, lowercase, with no space) and add a file about yourself there. Start by copying the content from a preexisting author file. If a tutorial is written by multiple authors, use the following syntax in the header: authors: [1ST_AUTHOR_ID, 2ND_AUTHOR_ID, ...] the creation date, in the specified format (year-month-day), e.g. 2019-01-04 or 2018-04-02 one or two categories from the specified list available here multiple tags you can pick yourself, all lowercase words. Have a look at the current wordcloud to check which would be useful for your submission.  Underneath the last triple dahs (---), you can write the tutorial as you like using markdown syntax. Use the Preview button to check how it would look like rendered on a website.\nNotice: You can add images from online source by using the URL of the image, e.g. ![short image description](http://.../my_image.jpg). For example, https://www.inbo.be/sites/all/themes/bootstrap_inbo/img/inbo/logo_nl.png will include the INBO logo into your document:\nIf you are ready, commit your file to the website maintainers by filling in the boxes:\n Create new file: exchange this by a short message about the additions, e.g. Add tutorial to explain tidy data in R or Add tutorial about database queries in inboveg,\u0026hellip; Add an optional extended description: If you think more background info is suitable, add that in this box. yourgithubnam-patch you can replace this by the same name as your folder name above (e..g. r_tidy_data) to clarify your submission.  (the checkbox will always be on create a new branch, this is also the required option)\nNext, click commit new file and your submission will be reviewed by the website maintainers. If accepted, the tutorial will be automatically integrated in the tutorials website.\nUsing git (or Github Desktop, Rstudio,\u0026hellip;) When you ever used git or Github before, either using the command line, rstudio, Github Desktop,\u0026hellip; you can work on your own computer and submit the tutorial using git. In this section, we assume you are familiar to the git command or interface and have some basic knowledge. If not, no worries, we have a dedicated course to get you up to speed, see the INBO git course.\nNotice: The links in the different steps will refer to the Rstudio steps in the INBO git tutorial, but can be done using other interfaces or the command line as well. Pick the one you prefer\nIf it is your first submission using your computer, clone the INBO tutorials repository (so use the clone button on the https://github.com/inbo/tutorials page!).\nNext, we use the git workflow to submit the new tutorial:\n Update your code and create a new branch, cfr. STEP 1 of the workflow. Provide a useful name for your branch related to the topic of your tutorial, e.g. r_tidy_data or database_query_inboveg and not my_tutorial. Navigate to the subfolder content/tutorials and create a new subfolder in this directory. This will be the directory of your tutorial. Again, use a representative name for the directory name similar to the branch name. Within the folder, create a new file markdown index.md. The header of this file has an agreed format and you should copy paste this to start with:  --- title: \u0026quot;YOUR TITLE\u0026quot; description: \u0026quot;SHORT DESCRIPTION ON TUTORIAL\u0026quot; authors: [YOUR_AUTHOR_ID] date: YYYY-MM-DD categories: [\u0026quot;YOUR_CATEGORY\u0026quot;] tags: [\u0026quot;FIRST_TAG\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SECOND_TAG\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;] --- # your text starts here...

Start by copying the content from a preexisting author file. If a tutorial is written by multiple authors, use the following syntax in the header: authors: [1ST_AUTHOR_ID, 2ND_AUTHOR_ID, ...] the creation date, in the specified forma (year-month-day), e.g. 2019-01-04 or 2018-04-02 one or two categories from the specified list available here multiple tags you can pick yourself, all lowercase words. Have a look at the current wordcloud to check which would be useful for your submission.  Underneath the last triple dahs (---), you can write the tutorial as you like using markdown syntax.\n add/commit the file to git, cfr. STEP 2 of the workflow. You can commit the tutorial all in once or split the commits in different steps, that is up to you. To make sure your work is updated online as well, push the tutorial as in STEP 3 of the workflow. When ready, push your tutorial a last time and create a Pull request to the website maintainers as explained in STEP 4 of the workflow.  After you pull request, your submission will be checked and reviewed. When accepted and merged, you tutorial will be online.\n2. Writing an Rmarkdown tutorial As you are writing the tutorial in Rmarkdown, we assume you are using Rstudio to write the tutorial. In this section, we assume you are familiar to the Rstudio git interface and have some basic knowledge. If not, no worries, we have a dedicated course to get you up to speed with git in Rstudio, see the INBO git course.\nIf it is your first submission using your computer, clone the INBO tutorials repository (so use the clone button on the https://github.com/inbo/tutorials page!).\nNext, we use the git workflow to submit the new tutorial:\n Update your code and create a new branch, cfr.

Navigate to the subfolder content/tutorials and create a new subfolder in this directory. This will be the directory of your tutorial. Again, use a representative name for the directory name similar to the branch name. Within the folder, create a new file markdown index.Rmd. The header of this file has an agreed format and you should copy paste this to start with:  --- title: \u0026quot;YOUR TITLE\u0026quot; description: \u0026quot;SHORT DESCRIPTION ON TUTORIAL\u0026quot; authors: [YOUR_AUTHOR_ID] date: YYYY-MM-DD categories: [\u0026quot;YOUR_CATEGORY\u0026quot;] tags: [\u0026quot;FIRST_TAG\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;SECOND_TAG\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;] output: md_document: preserve_yaml: true variant: gfm+footnotes --- # your text starts here...

Have a look at the current wordcloud to check which would be useful for your submission. leave the output section as it is  Underneath the last triple dahs (---), you can write the tutorial as you like using markdown syntax and add code chunks to run R code.\nAs the Rmarkown file will not be part of the website, make sure to click the knit button to create the equivalent markdown file (index.md) in the same directory:\nNotice: always knit the Rmarkdown file before you start committing the changes!\n add/commit both files to git, cfr. STEP 2 of the workflow. You can commit the tutorial all in once or split the commits in different steps, that is up to you. To make sure your work is updated online as well, push the tutorial as in STEP 3 of the workflow. When ready, push your tutorial a last time and create a Pull request to the website maintainers as explained in STEP 4 of the workflow.  After you pull request, your submission will be checked and reviewed. When accepted and merged, you tutorial will be online.\nTips In the rare cases where your tutorial includes a link to a raw HTML document (to be delivered as-is, without any visual integration in the rest of the INBO tutorials website), you can proceed like this:\n Place your HTML document in static/html (in the top directory of the site, outside of tutorials, articles, \u0026hellip;) To link it, use a relative URL (.. can be used to point to the parent directory). The content of the static directory is accessible at the root URL.  This should be more clear with a practical example:\nThe file at content/tutorials/r_beginners/index.md has a link to a static HTML file in static/html/Rmarkdown_oefening_resultaat.html.\nSince that tutorial page will be visible at the tutorials/r_beginners/ relative URL and that the static file will be accessible at html/Rmarkdown_oefening_resultaat.html, you need to create a link that goes up twice to reach the site root before going down in the html directory, for example:\n[Oefening](../../html/Rmarkdown_oefening_resultaat.html)\n","href":"/tutorials/create_tutorial/","title":"Create tutorial"},{"content":"Check the administrator installation or user installation pages in function of the administrator rights on your computer.\n","href":"/tutorials/installation/","title":"Installation notes"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/checklist/","title":"checklist"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://inbo.github.io/checklist/articles/zenodo.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_checklist_zenodo/","title":"checklist: Setting up the integration between GitHub, Zenodo and ORCID"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/r/","title":"r"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/categories/r/","title":"r"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/thierryo/","title":"thierryo"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/vignette/","title":"vignette"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/frictionless/","title":"frictionless"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://frictionlessdata.github.io/frictionless-r/articles/frictionless.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_frictionless_frictionless/","title":"frictionless: Introduction to frictionless"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/peterdesmet/","title":"peterdesmet"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/stijnvanhoey/","title":"stijnvanhoey"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/waterinfo/","title":"wateRinfo"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://docs.ropensci.org/wateRinfo/articles/wateRinfo.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_waterinfo_waterinfo/","title":"wateRinfo: Introduction to downloading time series data from waterinfo.be"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/damianooldoni/","title":"damianooldoni"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/etn/","title":"etn"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://inbo.github.io/etn/articles/acoustic_telemetry.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_etn_acoustic_telemetry/","title":"etn: Explore acoustic telemetry data"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/ambermertens/","title":"ambermertens"},{"content":"Introduction and setup This tutorial originated while preparing an R-demonstration during a GIS club at INBO on 16 September 2021. (Further material of the GIS club is available here.)\nA straightforward approach for transforming spatial data is available in another tutorial. The current tutorial tackles a few extra aspects.\nThe tutorial assumes you have some pre-existing knowledge:\n Basic knowledge about coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and geodetic datums; see another tutorial and the references and links therein. Knowing how to read geospatial files with sf. There is another tutorial demonstrating some aspects.  In this tutorial we will apply conversions (without datum shift) and transformations (with datum shift) to sf and sfc objects. In the background, these operations use the PROJ library.\nLet’s load the needed R packages and prepare a more appropriate theme for mapping with ggplot2:\nlibrary(dplyr) library(sf) library(ggplot2) theme_set(theme_bw()) theme_update(panel.grid = element_line(colour = \u0026#34;grey80\u0026#34;)) library(mapview) Set up input data if needed:\nif (!file.exists(file.path(gisclubdata_path, \u0026#34;gemeenten_belgie.shp\u0026#34;))) { googledrive::drive_download(googledrive::as_id(\u0026#34;1-epL-fyKB8eS-WwuZhjsl8uyZYplAqFA\u0026#34;), file.path(tempdir(), \u0026#34;data_gisclub.zip\u0026#34;)) unzip(file.path(tempdir(), \u0026#34;data_gisclub.zip\u0026#34;), exdir = tempdir()) list.files(file.path(tempdir(), \u0026#34;data_gisclub\u0026#34;), full.names = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% file.copy(gisclubdata_path, recursive = TRUE) } The code assumes that you have a gisclubdata_path object defined (directory path as a string).\nJoining and mapping polygon layers For a given municipalities and watercourses dataset, we would like to append the municipality name to the watercourses by making a spatial join.\nReading data and trying to join Let’s read the data file of Belgian municipalities:\npath_municipalities \u0026lt;- file.path(gisclubdata_path, \u0026#34;gemeenten_belgie.shp\u0026#34;) municipalities \u0026lt;- read_sf(path_municipalities) It looks like this:\nmunicipalities Simple feature collection with 581 features and 3 fields Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON Dimension: XYZ Bounding box: xmin: 2.541331 ymin: 49.49695 xmax: 6.408098 ymax: 51.50511 z_range: zmin: 0 zmax: 0 Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 # A tibble: 581 × 4 T_MUN_NL Shape_Leng Shape_Area geometry \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]\u0026gt; 1 ’s Gravenbrakel 0.759 0.0108 Z (((4.095037 50.66599 0, 4.095101 50.… 2 Aalst 0.676 0.0101 Z (((4.054666 50.99444 0, 4.054666 50.… 3 Aalter 0.735 0.0154 Z (((3.41099 51.15987 0, 3.41275 51.15… 4 Aarlen 0.951 0.0148 Z (((5.860749 49.72667 0, 5.860889 49.… 5 Aarschot 0.640 0.00807 Z (((4.927684 51.03717 0, 4.92797 51.0… 6 Aartselaar 0.265 0.00141 Z (((4.401293 51.14814 0, 4.400461 51.… 7 Aat 0.977 0.0163 Z (((3.756864 50.69743 0, 3.757621 50.… 8 Affligem 0.261 0.00229 Z (((4.114181 50.92559 0, 4.115272 50.… 9 Aiseau-Presles 0.393 0.00284 Z (((4.584122 50.43827 0, 4.584458 50.… 10 Alken 0.336 0.00361 Z (((5.275147 50.9102 0, 5.275645 50.9… # … with 571 more rows  It appears that the points have three coordinate dimensions (XYZ).

Various so-called ‘binary predicates’ can be used to define this relationship (see ?st_join), but the default one is st_intersects(), i.e. an intersection as defined by the ‘DE-9IM’ model of binary geometry relations. Since several watercourses intersect more than one municipality, several of them are repeated in watercourses_comm, each with another values for municipality.  We chose to make the spatial join in the EPSG:31370 CRS. However, we can equally do it on a spherical model of the Earth, when using the geographical coordinates. We expect the resulting joined attributes to be equivalent. Let’s check:\nst_join(st_transform(watercourses, \u0026#34;EPSG:4326\u0026#34;), municipalities) %\u0026gt;% st_drop_geometry %\u0026gt;% all.equal(watercourses_comm %\u0026gt;% st_drop_geometry) [1] TRUE  Mapping While it has only one attribute and 581 rows, the object size of municipalities_31370 is relatively large because its polygons have numerous vertices:\nobject.size(municipalities_31370) %\u0026gt;% format(units = \u0026#34;MB\u0026#34;) [1] \u0026quot;22.1 Mb\u0026quot;  This makes a simple map take long to render in R (not shown here; just try yourself):\nggplot(data = municipalities_31370) + geom_sf() For the sake of this exercise, we make a simplified derived object comm_simpl_31370 with fewer vertices:\ncomm_simpl_31370 \u0026lt;- st_simplify(municipalities_31370, dTolerance = 10) Its size is much smaller:\nobject.size(comm_simpl_31370) %\u0026gt;% format(units = \u0026#34;MB\u0026#34;) [1] \u0026quot;3 Mb\u0026quot;  So it renders faster.\nggplot(data = comm_simpl_31370) + geom_sf() However, mind that the simplification may be OK for mapping at an appropriate scale, but beware that information has been lost, so shapes have changed and gaps + overlaps will appear between polygons. Hence don’t use this simplified version if you process it further, or for detailed mapping.\nNote the latitude-longitude graticule: the map follows the CRS of the plotted object, but the graticule is latitude-longitude by default.\nWe can plot the graticule of another CRS with coord_sf():\nggplot(data = comm_simpl_31370) + geom_sf() + coord_sf(datum = \u0026#34;EPSG:31370\u0026#34;) The above is the most obvious choice here, since it’s the CRS of the object, but we could as well plot the graticule of e.g. EPSG:3035 (ETRS89-extended / LAEA Europe):\nggplot(data = comm_simpl_31370) + geom_sf() + coord_sf(datum = \u0026#34;EPSG:3035\u0026#34;) Next to the ggplot2 package, which we used above, interactive maps can be made with the mapview package.\nHere too, time to render differs between:\nmapview(municipalities_31370, legend = FALSE) and:\nmapview(comm_simpl_31370, legend = FALSE) Note: run the code to see this and the following interactive maps.\nIn this case, mapview is using the leaflet package with some nice defaults, but in the above examples it makes a color map by default because there’s only one attribute. We don’t want this and we make some further adjustments:\nmapview(comm_simpl_31370, col.regions = \u0026#34;pink\u0026#34;, alpha.regions = 0.3, legend = FALSE, map.types = \u0026#34;OpenStreetMap\u0026#34;) Note that a separate tutorial about leaflet is available on this website!\nBeware that mapview and leaflet produce maps in the ‘WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator’ CRS (EPSG:3857). For that to happen, mapview transforms spatial objects on-the-fly. Pseudo Mercator or Web Mercator is a much used projection in web mapping because the coordinate projection is computed much faster. However it should not be used in official mapping or as a projected CRS for geoprocessing, since it has more distortions (including shape) than e.g. the (truly) conformal Mercator projection (e.g. in CRS EPSG:3395 – WGS 84 / World Mercator – which is best used in the equatorial region).\nLet’s show two layers with mapview:\nmapview(list(comm_simpl_31370, watercourses), col.regions = c(\u0026#34;pink\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;), alpha.regions = c(0.2, 0.5), color = c(\u0026#34;grey\u0026#34;, NA), legend = FALSE, map.types = \u0026#34;OpenStreetMap\u0026#34;) Different transformation pipelines We consider a layer of points that correspond to locations where characteristics were determined of Flemish surfacewater bodies:\npath_points \u0026lt;- file.path(gisclubdata_path, \u0026#34;meetplaatsen_oppwater.shp\u0026#34;) points \u0026lt;- read_sf(path_points) Check the CRS:\nst_crs(points) Coordinate Reference System: User input: Amersfoort / RD New wkt: PROJCRS[\u0026quot;Amersfoort / RD New\u0026quot;, BASEGEOGCRS[\u0026quot;Amersfoort\u0026quot;, DATUM[\u0026quot;Amersfoort\u0026quot;, ELLIPSOID[\u0026quot;Bessel 1841\u0026quot;,6377397.155,299.1528128, LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1]]], PRIMEM[\u0026quot;Greenwich\u0026quot;,0, ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433]], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,4289]], CONVERSION[\u0026quot;RD New\u0026quot;, METHOD[\u0026quot;Oblique Stereographic\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,9809]], PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Latitude of natural origin\u0026quot;,52.1561605555556, ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8801]], PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Longitude of natural origin\u0026quot;,5.38763888888889, ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8802]], PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Scale factor at natural origin\u0026quot;,0.9999079, SCALEUNIT[\u0026quot;unity\u0026quot;,1], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8805]], PARAMETER[\u0026quot;False easting\u0026quot;,155000, LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8806]], PARAMETER[\u0026quot;False northing\u0026quot;,463000, LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8807]]], CS[Cartesian,2], AXIS[\u0026quot;easting (X)\u0026quot;,east, ORDER[1], LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1]], AXIS[\u0026quot;northing (Y)\u0026quot;,north, ORDER[2], LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1]], USAGE[ SCOPE[\u0026quot;Engineering survey, topographic mapping.\u0026quot;], AREA[\u0026quot;Netherlands - onshore, including Waddenzee, Dutch Wadden Islands and 12-mile offshore coastal zone.\u0026quot;], BBOX[50.75,3.2,53.7,7.22]], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,28992]]  The points object has the projected ‘Amersfoort / RD New’ CRS (EPSG:28992), which was created for The Netherlands – onshore. See e.g. Wikipedia for more background about this CRS.\nEssentially we are dealing with a different projected CRS than EPSG:31370. EPSG:28992 uses the ‘Amersfoort’ geodetic datum, defined using the ‘Bessel 1841’ ellipsoid, while EPSG:31370 has the ‘Reseau National Belge 1972’ datum, defined using the ‘International 1924’ ellipsoid.1\nWe will transform points (back) to EPSG:31370 since the data are outside the intended area of usage. Note that this dataset has been made for mere demonstrative purposes: since at least a part of the points fall outside the area of usage (geographic bounding box) of the ‘Amersfoort / RD New’ CRS, the dataset is not appropriate to start from. But let’s suppose it is all one had available to work with!\nStandard approach By default, the appropriate transformation pipeline (concatenated coordinate operations) can differ between different areas that are represented in a spatial dataset.

We can see that points west and south of the geographic bounding box for usage of the Dutch CRS have a different position depending on the applied approach.\nIt can be further investigated with mapview (note that this does a further reprojection to EPSG:3857):\nmapview(list(points_31370, points_31370_strict), col.regions = c(\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;green\u0026#34;)) Here it appears that the western and southern points of points_31370 were transformed with the ballpark-accuracy pipeline: they are way off the surfacewater bodies!\nIn this case, one might prefer enforcing the specific pipeline outside the geographic bounding box of EPSG:28992, as we did for points_31370_strict. However best explore the other pipelines as well, e.g. the most accurate one that doesn’t depend on a grid, and consider using that outside the geographic bounding box.\nBottomline is that you should be suspicious about coordinates outside the CRS’s geographic bounding box! So keep an eye on them when applying a default transformation procedure.\nFurther reading and more packages Much more information can be found in the online books by Pebesma \u0026amp; Bivand (2021) and Lovelace et al. (2019). The sf package has a nice website at https://r-spatial.github.io/sf; version 0.6-1 was introduced in Pebesma (2018).\nThere are several more R packages to make beautiful maps. We specifically mention tmap (Tennekes, 2018) and mapsf for making production-ready thematic maps. tmap is used a lot in Lovelace et al. (2019).\nFurther, there is the plotKML package, which renders spatial objects in Google Earth (Hengl et al., 2015)!\nBibliography Hengl T., Roudier P., Beaudette D. \u0026amp; Pebesma E.

In this tutorial we focus on best practices to further ease the citation experience when working with R Markdown documents. We also give some guidelines specific to the Research Institute for Nature and Forest.\nMore general tutorials can be found at the following web pages:\n https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/citations.html  The latter webpage is part of the documentation about the Visual Markdown Editing (VME) mode that is available since RStudio 1.4+ as an alternative to writing R Markdown documents in source mode. VME is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get1 interface for interacting with R Markdown. This interface is similar to writing documents in word processing software (google docs, MS Word, \u0026hellip;). Moreover, the VME mode has more functionalities for citations than the source mode. To switch between source mode and VME, press the button :\nIn this tutorial, we assume you are familiar with the basics of R Markdown or Bookdown.\nPreparing your R Markdown document to work with citations There are various places where you can specify things that impact working with citations. The most important are specifications you can provide in the YAML header of your R Markdown document. Next to that, the RStudio global and project options provide some additional settings.\nDocument level specifications (YAML header specifications) Specifying a bibliography You can specify one or more bibliography files with the bibliography argument in a number of formats, including the most commonly used formats at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest: CSL-JSON, CSL-YAML, BibTex and EndNote.\nWe strongly recommend however to use CSL-JSON or CSL-YAML, since CSL is the native format for Pandoc.2 All other bibliographic formats are internally converted to CSL-JSON, but with the exception of CSL-YAML this can in general not be perfect. Compared to CSL-JSON, Pandoc\u0026rsquo;s CSL-YAML has identical contents while having the most human-friendly syntax. CSL-JSON is the formal standard supported by all CSL processors3 .\nSome example specifications:\n--- author: Research Institute for Nature and Forest date: '`r format(Sys.Date())`' bibliography: references.yaml ---  Note that it is not even necessary at this stage that the bibliography file exists. It is possible to just give it a name and start adding citations in VME mode. When the first citation is inserted, for instance from a linked Zotero database, the file will be automatically created and the reference will be added to the file.\nFor users of Endnote, we recommend to export selected references to BibTeX format (as far as we know, it is not possible to export to CSL-JSON format). To do this:\n Edit -\u0026gt; Output Styles -\u0026gt; Open style manager and check the BibTex Export entry make sure that BibTex Export is checked in the Edit -\u0026gt; Output styles menu as well File -\u0026gt; Export, select Text file from the file type dropdown menu and save the file as \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;.bibtex  We recommend to only include references in the bibliography file that are cited in the document.\n--- author: Research Institute for Nature and Forest date: '`r format(Sys.Date())`' bibliography: - path/to/my/ref.json - other_references_from_endnote.bibtex ---  Specifying a citation style The Research Institute for Nature and Forest has its own citation style. There is a separate tutorial that shows how to use this style in various reference manager software.\nSpecifying a citation style is done in the YAML header using the csl argument. The csl argument should be a path or URL to a CSL style file. To specify the style file for the Research Institute for Nature and Forest it is best to use the URL of the most up to date version:\n--- author: Research Institute for Nature and Forest date: '`r format(Sys.Date())`' bibliography: ref.json csl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/research-institute-for-nature-and-forest.csl ---  Other YAML citation arguments The ymlthis field guide, Pandoc \u0026amp; associated citeproc documentation and RStudio VME citations section mention the following useful arguments:\n citation-abbreviations  Path to a CSL abbreviations JSON file, which can be used to translate from full journal titles to abbreviated journal titles. Examples of such files can be found here.\n link-citations  Logical. Add citations hyperlinks to the corresponding bibliography entries? Default is false.\n nocite  Citation IDs (@item1) to include in the bibliography even if they are not cited in the document. Including the wildcard pattern @* will include all citations in the bibliography regardless of whether they are cited in the document.\n suppress-bibliography  Logical. Suppress bibliography? Default is false.\n lang  Locale to use in formatting citations. If this is not set, the locale is taken from the default-locale attribute of the CSL file. en-US is used if a locale is not specified in either the metadata or the CSL file. The CSL style file of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest has been specifically checked and tailored for three different languages: lang: en, lang: nl and lang: fr.\n reference-section-title  If this has a value, a section header with this title will be added before the bibliography. If reference-section-title is not specified and the document ends with a section header, this final header will be treated as the bibliography header.\n zotero  Specify one or more Zotero libraries. Or false to turn of Zotero library entirely.\n  Here is an example of a valid YAML with all citation arguments:\n--- author: Research Institute for Nature and Forest date: '2022-02-02' bibliography: ref.json csl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/research-institute-for-nature-and-forest.csl citation-abbreviations: abbreviations.json link-citations: true nocite: - '@item1' - '@item2' suppress-bibliography: false lang: en-US zotero: true ---  Rstudio project and global options The project options allow you to select a Zotero reference manager library or libraries for the RStudio project you are working in. The default will detect your local Zotero library. It is also possible to point to other libraries, which can include a group library that is shared among co-workers.\nThe global options are more or less the same as the project options but will apply to all your RStudio projects. The defaults are OK.\nCiting documents Syntax The following Markdown syntax is used to refer to documents. It is based on citation keys and the basic building block is @citationkey.\n   syntax result (depending on chosen csl style)     @adams1975 concludes that \u0026hellip; Adams (1975) concludes that \u0026hellip;   @adams1975[p.33] concludes that \u0026hellip; Adams (1975, p. 33) concludes that \u0026hellip;   \u0026hellip; end of sentence [@adams1975]. \u0026hellip; end of sentence (Adams, 1975).   \u0026hellip; end of sentence [see @adams1975,p.33]. \u0026hellip; end of sentence (see Adams, 1975, p. 33).   delineate multiple authors with colon: [@adams1975; @aberdeen1958] delineate multiple authors with colon: (Aberdeen, 1958; Adams, 1975)    Insert a citation You can either type the syntax in source mode, or use the insert citation button in VME mode. Using the VME mode has multiple benefits:\n  autocompletion: typing @ will automatically show a list of available references\n  searching and inserting references using one of the following methods (from the menu: Insert -\u0026gt; Citation; or shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+F8)\n From the bibliography or bibliographies referred to in the YAML header\u0026rsquo;s bibliography field From a Zotero library From DOI Crossref DataCite PubMed    This means that the Zotero reference manager is highly recommended when you want to work smoothly with citations in R Markdown. This reference manager also integrates nicely with other word processing software such as MS Word and Googledocs.\nCiting R and R packages The knitr::write_bib() function comes in handy if you need to cite R packages. The first argument accepts a character vector of R package names and the second argument can be used to specify a packages.bib file to which the BibTex entries will be written.\nFor instance:\n# to cite specific packages knitr::write_bib(c(\u0026#34;base\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bookdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rmarkdown\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;packages.bib\u0026#34;) \u0026hellip; allows us to cite @R-base, @R-bookdown and @R-rmarkdown if we add packages.bib to the bibliography YAML field.\nBibliography placement By default, the bibliography will be placed at the end of the document. So, you will want a final header titled # References or # Bibliography at the end your document. See also the reference-section-title field that we discussed in Other YAML citation arguments.\nIf you want to place the bibliography somewhere else, for instance before the appendices, you can insert a div html tag in source mode:\n# References \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;refs\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; # Appendix  If you use the bookdown::gitbook output format, further tweaks are possible. This format allows you to write a html report or book that consists of multiple html pages. You can for instance choose to split each chapter of a report into separate html pages. In that case, by default, the bibliography is split and all citation items that are cited on a given html page are put at the end of that page, so that readers do not have to navigate to a different bibliography page to see the details of citations. This feature can be disabled by setting the split_bib YAML field to FALSE, in which case all citations cited in the entire report or book are put on a separate bibliography page. To do this, you can add specific keys in the YAML header:\n--- author: Research Institute for Nature and Forest date: '`r format(Sys.Date())`' site: bookdown::bookdown_site output: bookdown::gitbook: split_by: chapter split_bib: false ---  References Aberdeen J.E.C.

A coordinate reference system (CRS) – also called spatial reference system (SRS) – is what you need if you want to interpret numeric coordinates as actual point locations with reference to the Earth. Two types of coordinate reference system are much used in spatial science: geodetic and projected CRSs. The former serve only to locate coordinates relative to a 3D model of the Earth surface, while the latter add a projection to generate coordinates on a 2D map. Coordinate operations convert or transform coordinates from one CRS to another, and you often need them because the CRS may differ between dataset 1, dataset 2 or a specific mapping technology (such as leaflet).\nAs you can expect, a CRS is defined by several elements. Essentially, a CRS exists of:\n a coordinate system, a ‘datum’ (s.l.): it localizes the geodetic coordinate system relative to the Earth and needs a geometric definition of the ellipsoid, only for projected CRSs: coordinate conversion parameters that determine the conversion from the geodetic to the projected coordinates.  We will not go deeper into these components, because we want to focus on implementation. However it is highly recommended to read further about this, in order to better understand what a CRS means. A good contemporary resource in an R context is the section ‘Coordinate reference systems: background’ in Bivand (2019) (there is also an accompanying video of that lesson).\nThere are a few coordinated lists of CRSs around the globe, the most famous one being the EPSG dataset, where each CRS has a unique EPSG code. You can consult these CRSs interactively at https://epsg.org (official source) and through third-party websites such as https://jjimenezshaw.github.io/crs-explorer and http://epsg.io. For example, the ‘World Geodetic System 1984’ (WGS 84) is a geodetic CRS with EPSG code 4326, and ‘BD72 / Belgian Lambert 72’ is a projected CRS with EPSG code 31370.\nIn R, you can also search for CRSs and EPSG codes since these are included in the PROJ database, used by R packages like sf. An example for Belgian CRSs:\nproj_db \u0026lt;- system.file(\u0026#34;proj/proj.db\u0026#34;, package = \u0026#34;sf\u0026#34;) # For dynamically linked PROJ, provide the path to proj.db yourself: if (proj_db == \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) proj_db \u0026lt;- proj_db_path crs_table \u0026lt;- sf::read_sf(proj_db, \u0026#34;crs_view\u0026#34;) # extracts the \u0026#34;crs_view\u0026#34; table subset(crs_table, grepl(\u0026#34;Belg|Ostend\u0026#34;, name) \u0026amp; auth_name == \u0026#34;EPSG\u0026#34;)[2:5] # A tibble: 8 × 4 auth_name code name type \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; 1 EPSG 3447 ETRS89 / Belgian Lambert 2005 projected 2 EPSG 3812 ETRS89 / Belgian Lambert 2008 projected 3 EPSG 21500 BD50 (Brussels) / Belge Lambert 50 projected 4 EPSG 31300 BD72 / Belge Lambert 72 projected 5 EPSG 31370 BD72 / Belgian Lambert 72 projected 6 EPSG 5710 Ostend height vertical 7 EPSG 6190 BD72 / Belgian Lambert 72 + Ostend height compound 8 EPSG 8370 ETRS89 / Belgian Lambert 2008 + Ostend height compound  How did we represent a CRS in R? Evolutions in PROJ and GDAL. It is good to know this, but you can skip this section if you like.\nThe reason for writing this tutorial are the recent (and ongoing) changes in several important geospatial libraries, especially GDAL and PROJ. They are used by most geospatial tools, including the key geospatial R packages rgdal, sp, sf, stars, terra and raster.\nSince long, coordinate reference systems in R (and many other tools) have been represented by so called ‘PROJ.4 strings’ (or ‘proj4strings’), referring to the long-standing version 4 of the PROJ library. But, we will not use them here! It is discouraged to use ‘PROJ strings’1 any longer to represent a CRS; several string elements for CRSs are now deprecated or unsupported. Currently, PROJ (https://proj.org) regards PROJ strings only as a means of specifying a coordinate operation (conversions or transformations between CRSs). Performing coordinate operations is the main aim of PROJ.\nLet’s just have one last nostalgic peek (and then, no more!!) to the proj4string for EPSG:31370, the Belgian Lambert 72 CRS:2\n+proj=lcc +lat_1=51.16666723333333 +lat_2=49.8333339 +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.367486666666666 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-106.8686,52.2978,-103.7239,0.3366,-0.457,1.8422,-1.2747 +units=m +no_defs  Several reasons have led to recent changes in GDAL and PROJ, such as the former use of the WGS 84 CRS as an intermediate ‘hub’ in coordinate transformation or in defining a CRS’s datum (introducing unneeded errors), higher accuracy requirements in transformations and the availability of better CRS specification standards than PROJ strings. The changes are included in GDAL 3 and PROJ ≥ 6, which many R packages now support and promote.\nIn consequence, support for PROJ strings to represent a CRS is reduced and discouraged. It can still be done, preferrably adding the +type=crs element to distinguish such a string from modern PROJ strings. The latter represent a coordinate operation, not a CRS. Currently, support for most geodetic datums is already lacking in PROJ strings3 (unless one defines it indirectly, but likely less accurately, with the now deprecated +towgs84 key). The WGS 84 ensemble datum4 (datum:EPSG::6326) is now by default assumed for a CRS declared with a PROJ string.\nIf you want to read more about the changes, here are some recommended resources:\n https://www.r-spatial.org (at the time of writing, especially Pebesma \u0026amp; Bivand (2020)) Bivand (2020a) (rgdal vignette) Bivand (2020b) (video recording; see slides 45-66 in Bivand (2020c)) https://gdalbarn.com Nowosad \u0026amp; Lovelace (2020) (webinar and slides, also including other developments in spatial R)  What is the new way to represent a CRS in R? Answer: The current approach is the WKT2 string, a recent and much better standard, maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium. WKT stands for ‘Well-known text.’ ‘WKT2’ is simply the recent version of WKT, approved in 2019, so you can also refer to it as WKT.5\nFor example, this is the WKT2 string for WGS 84:\nGEOGCRS[\u0026quot;WGS 84 (with axis order normalized for visualization)\u0026quot;, ENSEMBLE[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\u0026quot;, MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1166]], MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1152]], MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1153]], MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1154]], MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1155]], MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1156]], MEMBER[\u0026quot;World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\u0026quot;, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,1309]], ELLIPSOID[\u0026quot;WGS 84\u0026quot;,6378137,298.257223563, LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,7030]], ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,6326]], PRIMEM[\u0026quot;Greenwich\u0026quot;,0, ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8901]], CS[ellipsoidal,2], AXIS[\u0026quot;geodetic longitude (Lon)\u0026quot;,east, ORDER[1], ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,9122]]], AXIS[\u0026quot;geodetic latitude (Lat)\u0026quot;,north, ORDER[2], ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433, ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,9122]]], USAGE[ SCOPE[\u0026quot;Horizontal component of 3D system.\u0026quot;], AREA[\u0026quot;World.\u0026quot;], BBOX[-90,-180,90,180]], REMARK[\u0026quot;Axis order reversed compared to EPSG:4326\u0026quot;]]  An alternative representation of the WKT2 string - not yet official at the time of writing - is PROJJSON. It is a more convenient format to use in coding.\nHow to specify a CRS in R? library(sp) library(raster) library(sf) Great news!\nThe R packages further down, and many that depend on them, now provide a means of CRS specification irrespective of the GDAL/PROJ version, hence compliant with newer GDAL/PROJ.\n  DO:\nThe general principle that we recommend is: specify the CRS by using the EPSG code, but do so without using a PROJ string.\nNote: in case you wish to define a custom CRS yourself, ideally use WKT2 or its more convenient PROJJSON counterpart.\n  DON’T:\nIt’s no longer advised to use PROJ strings to specify a CRS, such as +init=epsg:????, +proj=longlat, … (even though that might still work, their usage is discouraged).\n  Below it is demonstrated how to specify a CRS that is defined in the EPSG database (hence, having an EPSG code), for several important geospatial R packages: sf, sp and raster. Other geospatial R packages should normally inherit their approach.\nFirst, a practical note:\n Some packages internally still derive a PROJ string as well. This happens even while you did not enter a PROJ string. Note that the derived PROJ string will not be used further if you’re on GDAL 3 / PROJ ≥ 6, and a WKT2 string will be generated as well for actual use. In the presence of GDAL 3 / PROJ ≥ 6 and when using sp or raster, you will (at the time of writing) get a warning from rgdal about dropped keys in the generated PROJ strings.6 You can safely ignore this warning on condition that you didn’t define the CRS with a PROJ string. Also, you can suppress the warning with options(rgdal_show_exportToProj4_warnings = \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;) in the beginning of your script (before loading rgdal or dependent packages).  As a demo data set for vector data, we use a dataset of city centers (points) included in the rgdal package.\ncities \u0026lt;- st_read(system.file(\u0026#34;vectors/cities.shp\u0026#34;, package = \u0026#34;rgdal\u0026#34;)) This is how it looks like:\ncities Simple feature collection with 606 features and 4 fields Geometry type: POINT Dimension: XY Bounding box: xmin: -165.27 ymin: -53.15 xmax: 177.1302 ymax: 78.2 Geodetic CRS: WGS 84 First 10 features: NAME COUNTRY POPULATION CAPITAL geometry 1 Murmansk Russia 468000 N POINT (33.08604 68.96355) 2 Arkhangelsk Russia 416000 N POINT (40.64616 64.52067) 3 Saint Petersburg Russia 5825000 N POINT (30.45333 59.95189) 4 Magadan Russia 152000 N POINT (150.78 59.571) 5 Perm' Russia 1160000 N POINT (56.23246 58.00024) 6 Yekaterinburg Russia 1620000 N POINT (60.61013 56.84654) 7 Nizhniy Novgorod Russia 2025000 N POINT (43.94067 56.28968) 8 Glasgow UK 1800000 N POINT (-4.269948 55.86281) 9 Kazan' Russia 1140000 N POINT (49.14547 55.73301) 10 Chelyabinsk Russia 1325000 N POINT (61.39261 55.145)  We now convert it to a plain dataframe (non-spatial) with the XY coordinates as columns, for the sake of the exercise.

R spatial follows GDAL and PROJ development. https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2020/03/17/wkt.html (accessed September 21, 2020).\n  ‘PROJ string’ is the term used in current PROJ documentation. Here, we only use ‘PROJ.4 string’ (or ‘proj4string’) when referring specifically to the PROJ string appearance in version 4 of the PROJ software.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Note that the currently returned PROJ string for EPSG:31370, if requested from PROJ ≥ 6 or GDAL 3 (not shown), lacks the datum reference which, in PROJ.4, was defined indirectly by +towgs84 with the 7-parameter (Helmert) transformation to the WGS 84 datum. Hence the current PROJ string is a deficient representation of EPSG:31370.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Formerly, more geodetic datums could be specified in a PROJ string with the +datum key. Currently only WGS84, NAD27 and NAD83 are still supported this way. Further, if an ellipsoid is specified with +ellps (and that includes the WGS 84 ellipsoid), the datum of the resulting CRS is considered as ‘unknown.’ The usage of PROJ strings to define CRSs, including the +datum and +towgs84 elements, will remain supported for mere backward compatibility (to support existing data sets), but is regarded deprecated and is discouraged by PROJ.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n An ensemble datum is a collection of different but closely related datum realizations without making a distinction between them. By not specifying the applicable datum realization for a coordinate data set, some degree of inaccuracy is allowed when using an ensemble datum as part of a CRS.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n In order to emphasize the fact that the improvements in version 2 were instructive to the new versions of GDAL and PROJ, you will often see explicit mention of ‘WKT2.’\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The packages give a warning especially to make developers of other, dependent packages aware that they should also make sure their functions do not require PROJ strings or use hardcoded PROJ strings. Instead, they should defer the handling of CRS representation to the basic geospatial R packages (i.e. dependent on the version of PROJ/GDAL). So, the appearance of these warnings marks a period of transition in order to let other packages become GDAL 3 and PROJ ≥ 6 compliant. And the good news is that most popular geospatial packages have become GDAL 3 and PROJ ≥ 6 compliant!\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_crs_coding/","title":"Goodbye PROJ.4!

In computing, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS) Interface Standard provides an interface allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls. One can think of geographical features as the “source code” behind a map, whereas the Web Mapping Service (WMS) interface or online tiled mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze.\nThe standard output format for reading or downloading data from a WFS is the XML-based Geography Markup Language (GML), but other formats like shapefiles or geojson are also available. In early 2006 the OGC members approved the OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile. This profile is designed both to increase interoperability between WFS servers and to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard. (Source: Wikipedia)\nBefore we embark on using a WFS service in R, we would like to draw your attention to the following issue when using a WFS service in a workflow that needs to be reproducible in the longer term. A distributed, stable storage of the GIS data used in a workflow is necessary to make that workflow reproducible on a longer term. When using dynamic databases and web services, where the data they present are expected to evolve (e.g. by always pointing at the latest release in these WFS-cases), this is not guaranteed if you just use the WFS service to directly read GIS data from it. Instead of directly reading the GIS data, it is also possible to download the data from the WFS service to disk (and possibly archive on, e.g., Zenodo) in order to obtain a stable version that can be re-used later by reading it from disk. Also, in case it takes a long time to get the GIS data from the WFS service, downloading instead of directly reading is often a better choice. On the other hand, some types of workflows might instead require the most up to date GIS data that are available to be retrieved while no workflow reproducibility is needed. Do note that publishing the workflow is always recommended for published work. It serves the scientific community and it is also a way of proving scientific quality - hence reproducibility is often the best choice for published work.\nSome of the material presented in this tutorial benefitted from a tutorial presented at the Use of R in Official Statistics conference in The Hague, September 2018 Spatial Analysis in R with Open Geodata, from Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow (2020) and from this Dutch wordpress blogpost.\nUseful overviews of web feature services WFS services for Belgium and regions in Belgium:\n overview of WFS services for Flanders region overview compiled by Michel Stuyts, which is also available on gitlab overview maintained by DOV Vlaanderen  European portals:\n inspire geoportal: European portal for spatial data - some of which have a WFS service environmental data for Europe: many of the products listed have either a WMS or a WFS service  Worldwide coverage:\n spatineo directory  Used packages library(sf) # simple features packages for handling vector GIS data ## Linking to GEOS 3.9.0, GDAL 3.2.1, PROJ 7.2.1  library(httr) # generic webservice package library(tidyverse) # a suite of packages for data wrangling, transformation, plotting, ... ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ── ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.3 ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ✓ tibble 3.1.2 ✓ dplyr 1.0.6 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.3 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 1.4.0 ✓ forcats 0.5.1 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()  library(ows4R) # interface for OGC webservices ## Loading required package: geometa ## Loading ISO 19139 XML schemas... ## Loading ISO 19115 codelists...  Get to know what the service can do with GetCapabilities First of all we need the URL of the service.\nwfs_bwk \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://geoservices.informatievlaanderen.be/overdrachtdiensten/BWK/wfs\u0026#34; Next, we append information to the URL address with the aid of httr::parse_url and httr::build_url. The former function parses an URL into a list for easier programmatic addition of information to the URL. The latter function does the reverse and builds the URL from the list object.\nThe url$query slot is where you instruct the WFS what information it should return. It is constructed as a list with name-value pairs. For now, we only need to specify the GetCapabilities request. Other information such as passing version = 2.0.0 can be added, but is not required (by default, the latest version of the WFS service will be chosen).\nurl \u0026lt;- parse_url(wfs_bwk) url$query \u0026lt;- list(service = \u0026#34;wfs\u0026#34;, #version = \u0026#34;2.0.0\u0026#34;, # facultative request = \u0026#34;GetCapabilities\u0026#34; ) request \u0026lt;- build_url(url) request ## [1] \u0026quot;https://geoservices.informatievlaanderen.be/overdrachtdiensten/BWK/wfs?service=wfs\u0026amp;request=GetCapabilities\u0026quot;  With GetCapabilities, we obtain a complete overview of all metadata for the web service.\nTo see all capabilities, you can visit the request in the webbrowser. For instance opening the page in the webbrowser and searching for “Filter_Capabilities” allows you to see all possible ways to filter the data from a WFS layer (e.g. restrict the downloaded data to a specified bounding box with SpatialOperator name=\u0026quot;BBOX\u0026quot;).\nInstead of searching the page on the web, there are several ways to access specific pieces of information programmatically. We will show here how to do this using functions in the ows4R package. The first thing we need to do is generate a connection to the WFS with the aid of WFSClient$new().\nbwk_client \u0026lt;- WFSClient$new(wfs_bwk, serviceVersion = \u0026#34;2.0.0\u0026#34;) #serviceVersion must be provided here ## Warning in CPL_crs_from_input(x): GDAL Message 1: +init=epsg:XXXX syntax is ## deprecated. It might return a CRS with a non-EPSG compliant axis order.  The resulting object bwk_client is an R6 object. If you are not familiar with R6 object, you might want to read the R6 chapter in Advanced R.\nPrinting `bwk_client looks like this:\nbwk_client ## \u0026lt;WFSClient\u0026gt; ## Inherits from: \u0026lt;OWSClient\u0026gt; ## Public: ## attrs: list ## capabilities: WFSCapabilities, OWSCapabilities, OGCAbstractObject, R6 ## clone: function (deep = FALSE) ## defaults: list ## describeFeatureType: function (typeName) ## encode: function (addNS = TRUE, geometa_validate = TRUE, geometa_inspire = FALSE) ## ERROR: function (text) ## getCapabilities: function () ## getClass: function () ## getClassName: function () ## getFeatures: function (typeName, ...) ## getFeatureTypes: function (pretty = FALSE) ## getPwd: function () ## getToken: function () ## getUrl: function () ## getUser: function () ## getVersion: function () ## INFO: function (text) ## initialize: function (url, serviceVersion = NULL, user = NULL, pwd = NULL, ## logger: function (type, text) ## loggerType: NULL ## reloadCapabilities: function () ## url: https://geoservices.informatievlaanderen.be/overdrachtdi ... ## verbose.debug: FALSE ## verbose.info: FALSE ## version: 2.0.0 ## WARN: function (text) ## wrap: FALSE ## Private: ## pwd: NULL ## serviceName: WFS ## system_fields: verbose.info verbose.debug loggerType wrap attrs defaults ## token: NULL ## user: NULL ## xmlElement: NULL ## xmlNamespace: NULL ## xmlNodeToCharacter: function (x, ..., indent = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, tagSeparator = \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)  The features listed can be accessed using $. We can see that some of them are again functions. As a first example, the following code will list all available layers for that WFS.\nbwk_client$getFeatureTypes(pretty = TRUE) ## name title ## 1 BWK:Bwkhab BWK 2 - BWK-zone en Natura 2000 Habitat ## 2 BWK:Bwkfauna BWK 2 - Faunistisch belangrijke gebieden ## 3 BWK:Hab3260 BWK 2 - Habitattype 3260  Another way of accessing this information is:\nbwk_client$getFeatureTypes() %\u0026gt;% map_chr(function(x){x$getName()}) ## [1] \u0026quot;BWK:Bwkhab\u0026quot; \u0026quot;BWK:Bwkfauna\u0026quot; \u0026quot;BWK:Hab3260\u0026quot;  bwk_client$getFeatureTypes() %\u0026gt;% map_chr(function(x){x$getTitle()}) ## [1] \u0026quot;BWK 2 - BWK-zone en Natura 2000 Habitat\u0026quot; ## [2] \u0026quot;BWK 2 - Faunistisch belangrijke gebieden\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;BWK 2 - Habitattype 3260\u0026quot;  We are using purrr::map() functionalities here, because the output of bwk_client$getFeatureTypes() is a list and each element of the list contains information about a layer.\nLet’s turn back our attention to getCapabilities() and see what information we can extract from it.\nbwk_client$getCapabilities() ## \u0026lt;WFSCapabilities\u0026gt; ## Inherits from: \u0026lt;OWSCapabilities\u0026gt; ## Public: ## attrs: list ## clone: function (deep = FALSE) ## defaults: list ## encode: function (addNS = TRUE, geometa_validate = TRUE, geometa_inspire = FALSE) ## ERROR: function (text) ## findFeatureTypeByName: function (expr, exact = TRUE) ## getClass: function () ## getClassName: function () ## getFeatureTypes: function (pretty = FALSE) ## getOperationsMetadata: function () ## getOWSVersion: function () ## getRequest: function () ## getService: function () ## getServiceIdentification: function () ## getServiceProvider: function () ## getServiceVersion: function () ## getUrl: function () ## INFO: function (text) ## initialize: function (url, version, logger = NULL) ## logger: function (type, text) ## loggerType: NULL ## verbose.debug: FALSE ## verbose.info: FALSE ## WARN: function (text) ## wrap: FALSE ## Private: ## featureTypes: list ## fetchFeatureTypes: function (xmlObj, version) ## operationsMetadata: OWSOperationsMetadata, R6 ## owsVersion: 1.1 ## request: OWSGetCapabilities, OWSRequest, OGCAbstractObject, R6 ## service: WFS ## serviceIdentification: OWSServiceIdentification, R6 ## serviceProvider: OWSServiceProvider, R6 ## serviceVersion: 2.0.0 ## system_fields: verbose.info verbose.debug loggerType wrap attrs defaults ## url: https://geoservices.informatievlaanderen.be/overdrachtdi ... ## xmlElement: NULL ## xmlNamespace: NULL ## xmlNodeToCharacter: function (x, ..., indent = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, tagSeparator = \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)  This is again an R6 class object and the $ can be used to chain together several functions, much in the same way as the pipe operator %\u0026gt;%.

We store the data in GeoJSON format which is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation.\nWe also add the bounding box from which we want to retrieve the data. This is very important to add. If you omit a bounding box, the service will return the entire map which can be very large.\nurl \u0026lt;- parse_url(wfs_bwk) url$query \u0026lt;- list(service = \u0026#34;WFS\u0026#34;, #version = \u0026#34;2.0.0\u0026#34;, # optional request = \u0026#34;GetFeature\u0026#34;, typename = \u0026#34;BWK:Bwkhab\u0026#34;, bbox = \u0026#34;142600,153800,146000,156900\u0026#34;) request \u0026lt;- build_url(url) Let’s check what we are about to read with sf::st_layers().

Those are features which have only some part within the bounding box.\nggplot(bwk_hallerbos) + geom_sf() You can use sf::st_write() to save this layer in any format that is listed by sf::st_drivers().\nExample 4: downloading data to disk Continuing from the previous example, we can download the data with httr::GET and httr::write_disk(). The only difference is that we add outputFormat to the request. In this way we can deviate from the default output format and choose the output format we like.\nurl \u0026lt;- parse_url(wfs_bwk) url$query \u0026lt;- list(service = \u0026#34;WFS\u0026#34;, #version = \u0026#34;2.0.0\u0026#34;, # optional request = \u0026#34;GetFeature\u0026#34;, typename = \u0026#34;BWK:Bwkhab\u0026#34;, bbox = \u0026#34;142600,153800,146000,156900\u0026#34;, outputFormat = \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;) request \u0026lt;- build_url(url) file \u0026lt;- tempfile(fileext = \u0026#34;.geojson\u0026#34;) GET(url = request, write_disk(file)) ## Response [https://geoservices.informatievlaanderen.be/overdrachtdiensten/BWK/wfs?service=WFS\u0026amp;request=GetFeature\u0026amp;typename=BWK%3ABwkhab\u0026amp;bbox=142600%2C153800%2C146000%2C156900\u0026amp;outputFormat=application%2Fjson] ## Date: 2021-06-24 16:01 ## Status: 200 ## Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8 ## Size: 821 kB ## \u0026lt;ON DISK\u0026gt; /tmp/RtmpezMQfd/file55153cbee022.geojson  At this point, all features are downloaded and can be used in R as we would with any other local file.

When working in a local GIS environment, one would use a spatial operator to extract the data (e.g. within, intersects, contains,…). As we discussed earlier, WFS supports certain spatial operators as part of the service to directly query this data and overcomes the need to download the spatial feature data first.\nConsider the following use case: You want to extract the attribute data from a soil map for a number of sampling points (point coordinates). This use case can be tackled by relying on the WFS service and the affiliated spatial operators.\nOur example data point (in Lambert 72):\nx_lam \u0026lt;- 173995.67 y_lam \u0026lt;- 212093.44 From this point we know the data, so we can verify the result (in Dutch):\n Bodemtype: s-Pgp3(v) Bodemserie: Pgp Textuurklasse: licht zandleem Drainageklasse: uiterst nat, gereduceerd  Hence, we now want to extract these soil properties from the WFS, for the coordinates defined above.\nproperties_of_interest \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;Drainageklasse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Textuurklasse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bodemserie\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bodemtype\u0026#34;) The URL of the wfs service of the soil map of the Flemish region:\nwfs_bodemtypes \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/geoserver/bodemkaart/bodemtypes/wfs\u0026#34; The essential part is to set up the proper query! The required data for the service is defined in the metadata description. This can look a bit overwhelming at the start, but is a matter of looking for some specific elements of the (XML) document:\n service (WFS) and request (GetFeature) are mandatory fields (see below); version (1.1.0) is optional typeName: Look at the different \u0026lt;FeatureType... enlisted and pick the \u0026lt;Name\u0026gt; of the one you’re interested in. In this particular case bodemkaart:bodemtypes is the only one available. outputFormat: The supported output formats are enlisted in \u0026lt;ows:Parameter name=\u0026quot;outputFormat\u0026quot;\u0026gt;. As the service provides CSV as output, this is a straightforward option. json is another popular one. propertyname: A list of the attribute table fields (cfr. supra). A full list of the Flanders soil map is provided here. We also define the CRS, using the EPSG code. CQL_FILTER: Define the spatial operator, in this case INTERSECTS of the WFS geom and our POINT coordinate. The operators are enlisted in the \u0026lt;ogc:SpatialOperators\u0026gt; field.

This is done to optimize performance (responsiveness) of the WFS service: it is more efficient to transfer small packages of data and this is even more the case when multiple user requests are transmitted concurrently to the service.\nIn this example we show how to deal with this situation. A technique called ‘pagination’ can be used to obtain all features one is interested in by sending multiple requests to the server. The service is available from version ‘2.0.0’ onwards. Servers running older versions may or may not have support for ‘pagination.’\nWe will use the ‘Watervlakken’ WFS service for this example.\n# this layer returns just 1000 features (for performance reasons) wfs \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;https://gisservices.inbo.be/arcgis/services/Watervlakken/MapServer/WFSServer?\u0026#34; url \u0026lt;- parse_url(wfs) url$query \u0026lt;- list(service = \u0026#34;wfs\u0026#34;, version = \u0026#34;2.0.0\u0026#34;, # facultative request = \u0026#34;GetFeature\u0026#34;, typename = \u0026#34;Watervlakken:Watervlakken\u0026#34;, srsName = \u0026#34;EPSG:31370\u0026#34; ) request \u0026lt;- build_url(url) gd \u0026lt;- read_sf(request) gd ## Simple feature collection with 1000 features and 14 fields ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 136507.8 ymin: 187356 xmax: 192040.7 ymax: 237604.4 ## Projected CRS: Belge 1972 / Belgian Lambert 72 ## # A tibble: 1,000 x 15 ## gml_id WVLC WTRLICHC HYLAC NAAM GEBIED KRWTYPE KRWTYPES DIEPKL CONNECT ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 Zwalu… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 2 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 3 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 4 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 5 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 6 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 7 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 8 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 9 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 10 Watervla… ANTBR… \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; 0 \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## # … with 990 more rows, and 5 more variables: FUNCTIE \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, PEILBEHEER \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, ## # OPPWVL \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, OMTWVL \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, geometry \u0026lt;MULTIPOLYGON [m]\u0026gt;  As we can see from the output, only 1000 features are returned.\nTo know in advance how many features the WFS has in total, you can add resultType=\u0026quot;hits\u0026quot; to the query:\nurl$query \u0026lt;- list(service = \u0026#34;wfs\u0026#34;, version = \u0026#34;2.0.0\u0026#34;, # facultative request = \u0026#34;GetFeature\u0026#34;, typename = \u0026#34;Watervlakken:Watervlakken\u0026#34;, srsName = \u0026#34;EPSG:31370\u0026#34;, resultType = \u0026#34;hits\u0026#34; ) request \u0026lt;- build_url(url) result \u0026lt;- GET(request) parsed \u0026lt;- xml2::as_list(content(result, \u0026#34;parsed\u0026#34;)) ## No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.  n_features \u0026lt;- attr(parsed$FeatureCollection, \u0026#34;numberMatched\u0026#34;) n_features ## [1] \u0026quot;88713\u0026quot;  We see that there are 88713 features.

If not, and the only goal is visualization, we should have used a WMS (Web Mapping Service) instead (see this tutorial).\nDo we need all data from the WFS? We need to think carefully which features and which attributes are really needed for whatever use case we might have. When we have a clear idea which subset of the data we need, we can apply what we have learned in the examples in this tutorial to restrict the request to what we need.\nIf we find ourselves in the case where we think we really need to request many, many features from a WFS service, it may also be more advised to use a download service instead of a WFS (search) service.\nReferences Lovelace, Robin, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow. 2020.

Because software versions can have important effects on the results of your work, it is important to be able to reproduce versions.\nStart using renv For general advice on renv setup and usage, see https://rstudio.github.io/renv. The functions you mostly need, are renv::init(), renv::snapshot(), renv::status(), renv::restore() (always put renv::restore() in the beginning of your R code).\nWhen using git version control, you should commit all new untracked files created by renv::init(). The most important file is renv.lock, which defines R and package versions of the project.\nAim of this tutorial This tutorial addresses the specific aspect of how to update R and packages in an renv environment and store that information in renv.lock. It is typically needed while elaborating a project, because you wish to use the latest available packages and R version.\nProcedure Our recommended approach is:\n Update all installed packages in the default user R library of your system, i.e. outside an renv environment. See this tutorial. In this way these package versions will need to be downloaded and installed only once. You may also want to update packages from other sources, such as GitHub: use remotes::install_github(). Update packages, and possibly R, in a project renv environment, and store the new state in renv.lock.  To apply step 2, choose the applicable situation below. We assume you already applied step 1!\nOnly updating packages (keeping same R version) Within the project\u0026rsquo;s R session (with renv activated):\nrenv::upgrade() # upgrades renv, if new version is available renv::update() # updates packages from CRAN and GitHub, within the project renv::snapshot() # inspect the message before confirming to overwrite renv.lock Note:\n To update packages in the renv environment, renv will take package copies of your user R library if the required versions are available there. Note that the copies are stored in a global renv package cache, i.e. a central directory where renv stores packages versions for all projects where it is used, for each R x.y version, on an as-needed basis. The project environment itself is based on symlinks to the particular package versions in the cache.  If you use version control, then don\u0026rsquo;t forget to effectively commit the changed renv.lock file.\nUpdating R and packages This procedure is relevant to the x.y upgrades, not to the patches. That is, when x or y change in R version x.y.z. When only z has changed (i.e. a \u0026lsquo;patch\u0026rsquo;), previous procedure still applies.\nBelow procedure assumes:\n you already installed the new R version on your system; you already updated your R packages in the default user R library of your system; you have now started the project\u0026rsquo;s R session with the new R version (with renv activated).  renv::upgrade() # upgrades renv, if new version is available renv::hydrate(update = \u0026#34;all\u0026#34;) # populates the renv cache with copies of up to  # date package versions, needed by the project # renv::update() should have no effect now, but running it as well won\u0026#39;t harm  # to check that all packages are indeed up to date renv::snapshot() # inspect the message before confirming to overwrite renv.lock If you use version control, then don\u0026rsquo;t forget to effectively commit the changed renv.lock file.\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/r_renv_update/","title":"Updating the renv environment of an R project"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/cecileherr/","title":"cecileherr"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/janwouters/","title":"janwouters"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/n2khab/","title":"n2khab"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://inbo.github.io/n2khab/articles/v025_geospatial_hab.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_n2khab_v025_geospatial_hab/","title":"n2khab: Working with geospatial data sources of habitat (sub)types and RIBs"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/toonwestra/","title":"toonwestra"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://inbo.github.io/checklist/articles/philosophy.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_checklist_philosophy/","title":"checklist: Philosophy of the checklist package"},{"content":"See the vignette/tutorial at https://inbo.github.io/checklist/articles/getting_started.html\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/vignette_checklist_getting_started/","title":"checklist: Setting up checklist"},{"content":"In this article of the inborutils package it is explained how to use the functions download_knmi_data_hour, read_knmi_data, read_mow_data and read_kmi_data.\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/inborutils_download_data/","title":"(Down)load KNMI, KMI or MOW-HIC data using the inborutils package"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/categories/databases/","title":"databases"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/inborutils/","title":"inborutils"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/analysis-of-variance/","title":"analysis of variance"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/explorative-data-analysis/","title":"explorative data analysis"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/generalized-linear-regression/","title":"generalized linear regression"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/inla/","title":"INLA"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/mixed-model/","title":"mixed model"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/multivariate-statistics/","title":"multivariate statistics"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/categories/statistics/","title":"statistics"},{"content":"During the course of the years, we have taught many statistics courses at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), both for scientists and technicians.

R package protocolhelper: provides templates for protocols and helper functions to start developing a new protocol or move an existing protocol to the INBO protocols repository  Retrieve data General  R package frictionless: read and write Frictionless Data Packages. A Data Package is a simple container format and standard to describe and package a collection of (tabular) data. It is typically used to publish FAIR and open datasets. R package inbodb: connect to and retrieve data from databases on the INBO server, with dedicated functions to query some of these databases.  Environmental data  Python package pydov: to query and download data from Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen (DOV). DOV aggregates data about soil, subsoil and groundwater of Flanders and makes them publicly available. Interactive and human-readable extraction and querying of the data is provided by a web application, whereas the focus of this package is to support machine-based extraction and conversion of the data. R package wateRinfo: facilitates access to waterinfo.be, a website managed by the Flanders Environment Agency (VMM) and Flanders Hydraulics Research. The website provides access to real-time water and weather related environmental variables for Flanders (Belgium), such as rainfall, air pressure, discharge, and water level. The package provides functions to search for stations and variables, and download time series.

The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) is no exception.\nAll bibliography managers provide ways to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies which greatly facilitates scientific publishing. Depending on the bibliographic manager software, the style formatting rules are stored in specific files. In this tutorial you will learn how to use the INBO citation style in EndNote, Mendeley and Zotero bibliography managers.\nEndNote uses a *.ens file to store the style formatting rules, whereas Mendeley and Zotero use the open standard *.csl (Citation Style Language). EndNote, Zotero and Mendeley have recommended ways of finding and installing these files and will always point to the latest version of the style files when properly installed. This is explained in Use in bibliography managers.\nIn case you want to manually download the latest official CSL file of the INBO citation style (not the recommended way; better use your bibliography manager): it is available at the CSL style repository. In case older versions are needed, they can be obtained from successively numbered releases from our forked styles repo. To use older versions, you will need to manually download and add the file to your bibliography manager.\nThe EndNote *.ens file can be downloaded here (only accessible for INBO employees).\nCurious how the formatted INBO citation style and bibliography look like for various document types? Take a look at these links:\n PDF with English bibliography based on CSL HTML with English bibliography based on CSL PDF with Dutch bibliography based on CSL HTML with Dutch bibliography based on CSL  Use in bibliography managers Zotero   Open Zotero\n  Go to Edit \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Cite and click on “Get additional styles…”\n  In the search field in the popup window that opens type “Research Institute for Nature and Forest” and click on the corresponding link\n  There are good online tutorials that explain how to use Zotero in combination with google docs, MS Word and LibreOffice.\nMendeley   Open Mendeley\n  Go to View \u0026gt; Citation styles \u0026gt; More styles \u0026gt; Get more styles\n  In the search field type “Research Institute for Nature and Forest” and click “use this style”\n  Guidelines on how to use Mendeley in combination with MS Word or LibreOffice can be found here.\nEndNote   Download the INBO style file\n  If you do not already have a folder where style files are stored, create one (make sure you have read and write rights and choose a good location that will not be accidentally deleted (not on your desktop)\n  In EndNote go to Edit \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Folder Locations \u0026gt; Style Folder and choose the folder containing the style file(s)\n  Go to Edit \u0026gt; Output Styles \u0026gt; Open Style Manager and activate the INBO style and other styles you want to use (check the box)\n  The styles carry a name and version number, so they can be used at will.\n  The INBO style can now be used in Windows Word through the EndNote add-on.\n  The University of Melbourne provides good guidelines on how to use EndNote in combination with MS Word.\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/style_inbo_bibliography/","title":"Use of INBO citation style with bibliography managers"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/coding-club/","title":"coding club"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/data/","title":"data"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/authors/emmacartuyvels/","title":"emmacartuyvels"},{"content":"Before each coding club you will usually have to download some datasets and some scripts. This can be done manually from the corresponding GitHub webpages but it is much easier to use the setup_codingclub_session() function of the inborutils package.\nTo begin, make sure that you have the latest version of inborutils installed by running the following code:\nif (!\u0026#34;remotes\u0026#34; %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { install.packages(\u0026#34;remotes\u0026#34;) } remotes::install_github(\u0026#34;inbo/inborutils\u0026#34;) Next load the package:\nlibrary(inborutils) The function takes four arguments with the following default settings:\n session_date which is set to the present day root_dir which is set to the current/project directory \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; src_rel_path which is set to the subdirectory src data_rel_path which is set to the subdirectory data  So when we just run the function like this:\nsetup_codingclub_session() … we will get the coding club materials for the date of today (if and only if today there is a coding club, otherwise there are no materials and nothing will be downloaded). These materials will be saved in the src and data folders of the current working directory or project directory if you work within a RStudio project as recommended in the coding club’s getting started. R scripts are downloaded in src while datasets are downloaded in data using the date of today in the “YYYYMMDD” format as subfolders. Your coding club folder will look like this:\n├── src ├── YYYYMMDD └── YYYYMMDD_challenges.r └── data ├── YYYYMMDD ├── YYYYYMMDD_filename1.txt ├── YYYYYMMDD_filename2.txt # if more than one dataset is used └── ...  If you want to get the coding club materials for a past date, use the “YYYYMMDD” format, e.g. for material of August 25, 2020:\nsetup_codingclub_session(\u0026#34;20200225\u0026#34;) The subfolders ./src/20200225 and ./data/20200225 are automatically created and files downloaded if not present:\n├── src ├── 20200225 ├── 20200225_create_messy_project.r ├── 20200225_challenges.r └── 20200225_challenges_solutions.r └── data ├── 20200225 └── 20200225_urban_gaia_policy.txt  This function is also interactive: before downloading starts a message appears on screen showing the URL of the files to download and the absolute path where R scripts and data will be downloaded, followed by the question: Do you want to continue? (Y/n) as shown below:\nIf everything is ok, enter Y (y works as well, but it’s a kind of a secret…)\nIf your folders are not named src or data (although we recommend to name them as such) but for example scripts and data_codingclub you can specify them as such:\nsetup_codingclub_session(\u0026#34;20200225\u0026#34;, src_rel_path = \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;, data_rel_path = \u0026#34;data_codingclub\u0026#34;) ├── scripts ├── 20200225 ├── 20200225_create_messy_project.r ├── 20200225_challenges.r └── 20200225_challenges_solutions.r └── data_codingclub ├── 20200225 └── 20200225_urban_gaia_policy.txt  To make the function even more flexible, you can modify the root directory although you shouldn’t need to while working within an RStudio project. For example, if you want to move the root to the parent directory:\nsetup_codingclub_session(root_dir = \u0026#34;../\u0026#34;) Last but not least, you can always check examples and documentation online or via R console:\n?setup_codingclub_session Doesn’t setup_codingclub_session() work as expected? Do you think there is a bug? Or do you have some ideas to improve the function? Raise your hand! Write an issue or contact one of the INBO coding club organizers.

This is something we can expect to grow in the future.\nGDAL’s GPKG-raster driver itself is still less worked out than its drivers for GeoTIFF or GPKG-vector (note that one GPKG file can accommodate both layer types). For example, only the Byte, Int16, UInt16 and Float32 datatypes can be written by GDAL, while for GeoTIFFs these are Byte UInt16, Int16, UInt32, Int32, Float32, Float64, CInt16, CInt32, CFloat32 and CFloat64 2.\nFrom my experience, raster GeoPackage files are smaller than GeoTIFF files in the case of larger rasters. This, and the capability to combine raster and vector layers, certainly make it worthwile to consider the GeoPackage format for rasters, if you’re not hindered by the supported data types.\nMaking a single-raster GeoPackage from a RasterLayer R object This it is no more difficult than:\nartwork %\u0026gt;% writeRaster(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;, format = \u0026#34;GPKG\u0026#34;) ## Warning in .gd_SetNoDataValue(object, ...): setting of missing value not ## supported by this driver  A bit more information on the ‘missing value’ warning can be found in GDAL’s documentation of GeoPackage raster. You should know that the raster package does not yet officially support the GeoPackage! (see ?writeFormats())\nHowever, the stars package (see further)) fully supports GDAL’s capabilities, and therefore is able to write multiple raster layers, as we will do in a minute. Anyway, raster::writeRaster already works fine for single RasterLayer objects.\nReading the GeoPackage:\nartwork_gpkg \u0026lt;- raster(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;) artwork_gpkg ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 40, 37, 1480 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 50, 50 (x, y) ## extent : 188500, 190350, 227550, 229550 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=lcc +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.36748666666667 +lat_1=51.1666672333333 +lat_2=49.8333339 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs ## source : artwork.gpkg ## names : artwork ## values : 0.0001557397, 0.9997439 (min, max)  Let’s make sure: are the data we’ve read from the GeoTIFF identical to those from the GeoPackage?\nall.equal(artwork_test[], artwork_gpkg[]) ## [1] TRUE  Yeah!\nGiven that the GPKG-support of raster is limited, we’re lucky that Edzer Pebesma – the creator of sf – has also made the amazing package stars!!\nunlink(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;) # delete gpkg; we\u0026#39;re going to create it here again Sys.setenv(GDAL_PAM_ENABLED = \u0026#34;NO\u0026#34;) # prevents an auxiliary file being written next to *.gpkg library(stars) ## Loading required package: abind ## Loading required package: sf ## Linking to GEOS 3.10.1, GDAL 3.4.0, PROJ 8.2.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE  We could as well have written artwork to a GeoPackage with stars, so let’s just see what we get by converting the RasterLayer object to a stars object and then apply write_stars(), hm?\nartwork %\u0026gt;% st_as_stars %\u0026gt;% # this converts the RasterLayer to a stars object write_stars(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;, driver = \u0026#34;GPKG\u0026#34;) Reading it back with stars::read_stars(), followed by back-conversion to a RasterLayer:\nartwork_gpkg_stars \u0026lt;- read_stars(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% as(\u0026#34;Raster\u0026#34;) artwork_gpkg_stars ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 40, 37, 1480 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 50, 50 (x, y) ## extent : 188500, 190350, 227550, 229550 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=lcc +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.36748666666667 +lat_1=51.1666672333333 +lat_2=49.8333339 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs ## source : memory ## names : layer ## values : 0.0001557397, 0.9997439 (min, max)  And yes again, the data we’ve read from the GeoTIFF file are identical to those from the GeoPackage:\nall.equal(artwork_test[], artwork_gpkg_stars[]) ## [1] TRUE  That’s it!\nKnowing how to write and read with stars will help us for the multi-layer case!\nMaking a multi-raster GeoPackage Indeed, just as with vector layers, GeoPackage can accommodate multiple raster layers (or vector + raster layers).\nLet’s suppose we’d like to add layer2 (a RasterLayer) from the RasterBrick object arts.\narts$layer2 ## class : RasterLayer ## dimensions : 40, 37, 1480 (nrow, ncol, ncell) ## resolution : 50, 50 (x, y) ## extent : 188500, 190350, 227550, 229550 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=lcc +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.36748666666667 +lat_1=51.1666672333333 +lat_2=49.8333339 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs ## source : memory ## names : layer2 ## values : 10.00016, 10.99974 (min, max)  Unfortunately, the raster package does not support GDAL’s options to add extra raster layers in a GPKG file:\ntry( arts$layer2 %\u0026gt;% writeRaster(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;, format = \u0026#34;GPKG\u0026#34;, options = c(\u0026#34;RASTER_TABLE=layer2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES\u0026#34;)) ) ## Error in .getGDALtransient(x, filename = filename, options = options, : ## filename exists; use overwrite=TRUE  So let’s proceed with stars!\narts$layer2 %\u0026gt;% st_as_stars %\u0026gt;% write_stars(\u0026#34;artwork.gpkg\u0026#34;, driver = \u0026#34;GPKG\u0026#34;, options = c(\u0026#34;RASTER_TABLE=layer2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;APPEND_SUBDATASET=YES\u0026#34;)) Mind the options argument: those options are passed directly to GDAL’s GPKG-raster driver, and they’re documented at GDAL.\nOver there we read:\n RASTER_TABLE=string.

The sp package, used in this tutorial, is still maintained in order to support the newest versions of the GDAL and PROJ backends.\nSometimes we have a layer in one coordinate reference system (CRS) and need to transform it into another coordinate reference system. The first thing we need to do is identifying both coordinate reference systems. Let’s create an example and identify the coordinate reference system with wkt(). We used the coordinates posted on the contact page of NGI.\nlibrary(sp) library(leaflet) library(widgetframe) ## Loading required package: htmlwidgets  ngi \u0026lt;- data.frame(x = 650381.78, y = 667603.12) coordinates(ngi) \u0026lt;- ~x + y wkt(ngi) # show the CRS of an sp object ## Warning in wkt(ngi): CRS object has no comment ## NULL  NULL indicates that the coordinate reference system isn’t set. So we need to set it manually. In this case we know it is “Lambert 2008”. We need to know the related ‘WKT2 string’. The WKT2 string (well known text) is a recent open standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium to represent a coordinate reference system (CRS) - and it replaces the older (deprecated) PROJ.4 string.\nMost coordinate reference systems have an EPSG code which you can find at http://epsg.io/. The EPSG code for “Lambert 2008” is 3812. Let’s set this coordinate reference system to our dataset. CRS() defines the coordinate reference system.\nproj4string(ngi) \u0026lt;- CRS(SRS_string = \u0026#34;EPSG:3812\u0026#34;) ## Warning in showSRID(SRS_string, format = \u0026quot;PROJ\u0026quot;, multiline = \u0026quot;NO\u0026quot;, prefer_proj ## = prefer_proj): Discarded datum European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 in ## Proj4 definition  The proj4string() function refers to the older PROJ.4 strings to represent a CRS, which the sp package can still return for backward compatibility. The warning above demonstrates that some PROJ.4 information is not supported anymore. sp now uses the much better WKT2 representation, which it will derive directly from the EPSG-code that we provided (even though the function to assign a CRS to an object is still called proj4string()). The WKT2 string is what the geospatial GDAL and PROJ libraries (the background workhorses) work with since PROJ \u0026gt;= 6, and it looks like this:\nwkt_lambert2008 \u0026lt;- wkt(ngi) cat(wkt_lambert2008) ## PROJCRS[\u0026quot;ETRS89 / Belgian Lambert 2008\u0026quot;, ## BASEGEOGCRS[\u0026quot;ETRS89\u0026quot;, ## DATUM[\u0026quot;European Terrestrial Reference System 1989\u0026quot;, ## ELLIPSOID[\u0026quot;GRS 1980\u0026quot;,6378137,298.257222101, ## LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1]]], ## PRIMEM[\u0026quot;Greenwich\u0026quot;,0, ## ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433]], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,4258]], ## CONVERSION[\u0026quot;Belgian Lambert 2008\u0026quot;, ## METHOD[\u0026quot;Lambert Conic Conformal (2SP)\u0026quot;, ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,9802]], ## PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Latitude of false origin\u0026quot;,50.797815, ## ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8821]], ## PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Longitude of false origin\u0026quot;,4.35921583333333, ## ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8822]], ## PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Latitude of 1st standard parallel\u0026quot;,49.8333333333333, ## ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8823]], ## PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Latitude of 2nd standard parallel\u0026quot;,51.1666666666667, ## ANGLEUNIT[\u0026quot;degree\u0026quot;,0.0174532925199433], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8824]], ## PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Easting at false origin\u0026quot;,649328, ## LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8826]], ## PARAMETER[\u0026quot;Northing at false origin\u0026quot;,665262, ## LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,8827]]], ## CS[Cartesian,2], ## AXIS[\u0026quot;easting (X)\u0026quot;,east, ## ORDER[1], ## LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1]], ## AXIS[\u0026quot;northing (Y)\u0026quot;,north, ## ORDER[2], ## LENGTHUNIT[\u0026quot;metre\u0026quot;,1]], ## USAGE[ ## SCOPE[\u0026quot;Engineering survey, topographic mapping.\u0026quot;], ## AREA[\u0026quot;Belgium - onshore.\u0026quot;], ## BBOX[49.5,2.5,51.51,6.4]], ## ID[\u0026quot;EPSG\u0026quot;,3812]]  We could verify the correctness of this position by plotting it on a map.

Many UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, including FreeBSD, Apple\u0026rsquo;s Mac OS X, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle\u0026rsquo;s Solaris, IBM\u0026rsquo;s AIX and Z/OS, HP\u0026rsquo;s HP-UX and OpenVMS and others, include software for Kerberos authentication of users or services.\nHence, we can use the protocol to have an OS independent solution for authentication across different databases. In this document, the installation and configuration for linux/mac users is provided as well as an introduction to the usage of the authentication service to connect to databases. For windows users (in the domain) the authentication is provided by default.\nInstallation Kerberos client For debian/ubuntu users (make sure you belong to the sudo group):\nsudo apt-get install krb5-user sudo apt-get install openssl # if not yet available on your system (it probably is) During installation, you may be asked for extra configuration input.

Time synchronization This is needed in order to sync the timing of the domain controller server and client side.\nCheck whether the systemd-timesyncd daemon is already active on your system:\n$ systemctl status time-sync.target ● time-sync.target - System Time Synchronized Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/time-sync.target; static; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active since Mon 2020-09-07 08:27:03 CEST; 59min ago Docs: man:systemd.special(7) $ timedatectl status Local time: ma 2020-09-07 09:27:00 CEST Universal time: ma 2020-09-07 07:27:00 UTC RTC time: ma 2020-09-07 07:27:00 Time zone: Europe/Brussels (CEST, +0200) System clock synchronized: yes NTP service: active RTC in local TZ: no Note the line NTP service: active.\nIf you do have the systemd-timesyncd package but the unit is not active, run systemctl enable --now time-sync.target. Further information can be found here.\nOnly if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the systemd-timesyncd package, install ntp instead:\nsudo apt-get install ntp If you installed ntp, check whether the following two files do exist:\n /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp.conf.dhcp (empty file, just make sure there is a file)  MS SQL Server ODBC driver and tools As most of the databases at INBO are SQL Server, an appropriate driver and the command line toolset is required to fully support database connections to SQL Server.\nApart from the ODBC driver, we will also install following tools:\n sqlcmd: Command-line query utility. bcp: Bulk import-export utility.  For Linux, follow these installation instructions.1 For Mac, installation instructions can be found here.2\nAlso follow the \u0026lsquo;optional\u0026rsquo; instructions, as these will install the tools.\nHence, for Ubuntu 20.04 or Linux Mint 20 you would do:\nsudo su curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add - #Ubuntu 20.04 curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/prod.list \u0026gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list exit sudo apt-get update sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install msodbcsql17 mssql-tools echo \u0026#39;export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bash_profile echo \u0026#39;export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev On Ubuntu 20.04, if installing msodbcsql17 and mssql-tools fails because of incompatible unixodbc version, you can first try apt install unixodbc=2.3.6-0.1build1 unixodbc-dev=2.3.6-0.1build1.\nTest installation Kerberos ticket system To check if the Kerberos configuration is successful, ask for a ticket by initiating with kinit:\nkinit your_user_name If no errors are prodused, check the existing tickets with klist:\nklist This should produce a list of successfully granted tickets, so something similar as:\nValid starting Expires Service principal 03/01/18 15:42:08 04/01/18 01:42:08 krbtgt/INBO.BE@INBO.BE renew until 10/01/18 15:42:08 For Mac users, note that you can also use the Ticketviewer application which can be found in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications. Click Add Identity and enter your_user_name@INBO.BE and password.\nSQL database connections When the ticketing is working, the next step is to use the authentication to connect to the databases itself. To test this, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the sqlcmd command line tool. In a next section, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the ODBC settings.\nTesting with sqlcmd (make sure you have an active ticket). Type quit to exit.\nInbo staff can consult a list of connection strings ( including server names ) for a server to query link\nsqlcmd -S DBServerName -E 1\u0026gt; Select top 10 name from sys.databases; 2\u0026gt; Go On Ubuntu 20.04, you may get an error:\nSqlcmd: Error: Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server : TCP Provider: Error code 0x2746. Sqlcmd: Error: Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server : Client unable to establish connection. If you are in that case, have a look at working solutions in this GitHub issue.\nSQL ODBC connections To support database connections from other applications (e.g. GUI environments, but also R, Python,\u0026hellip;), the configuration of database drivers and connections should be provided in the /etc/odbc.ini and /etc/odbcinst.ini.\nMake sure the ODBC driver for SQL Server is available with a recognizable name in the /etc/odbcinst.ini file:\n[ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server] Description=Microsoft ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server Driver=/opt/microsoft/msodbcsql17/lib64/libmsodbcsql-17.6.so.1.1 UsageCount=1 Connecting by explicitly providing the SQL connection string to ODBC libraries/packages INBO staff can consult a list of connection strings here. At this moment, you can actually connect using typical ODBC libraries/packages provided by R or Python:\nlibrary(DBI) connection \u0026lt;- dbConnect( odbc::odbc(), .connection_string = \u0026#34;Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=DBServername;Database=DBName;Trusted_Connection=yes;\u0026#34; ) dbListTables(connection) However, most recommended for INBO staff using R is the use of the inbodb package, most notably the connect_inbo_dbase() function.\nimport pyodbc conn = pyodbc.connect(\u0026#34;Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=DBServername;Database=DBName;Trusted_Connection=yes;\u0026#34;) In RStudio, you can also make the connection with the GUI:\n Go to the Connections pane and click \u0026lsquo;New Connection\u0026rsquo;. In the window that opens, choose the ODBC Driver for SQL Server. In the Parameters field that comes next, add Server=DBServerName;Database=DBName;Trusted_Connection=yes;.  Note that the DBI connection statement is visible at the bottom field of the dialog window.   Click Test to verify successful connection.  If connection is unsuccessful, try again after explicitly adding your username to the connection string: User ID=your_username;   If the test is successful, click OK to make the connection.  Beside the fact that the connection has been made (see RStudio\u0026rsquo;s R console), you also get a list of all databases (of the specific SQL Server) in the Connections pane. You can use this for exploratory purposes. Click here for more information on using RStudio\u0026rsquo;s Connections pane.\nUNTESTED: Connecting after configuring odbc.ini However, it is probably easier to provide the configuration to specific databases directly, using the /etc/odbc.ini file. For example, the DBName database can be defined as follows:\n[nbn_ipt] Driver = ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server Description = odbc verbinding naar db Trace = No Server = DBServername Database = DBName Port = 1433 Next, add the DBServername\nTODO: -\u0026gt; example in R/Python -\u0026gt; also available in Rstudio!\n  You can also find the debian packages of Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server here.

We can formulate the test in terms of a mixed model. The benefit is that we get more informative model output, which allows us among other things to check if model assumptions were met. For the paired t-test, one assumption is that the paired differences between treatments follow a normal distribution. When these assumptions are not met, the flexibility of the mixed model framework allows to improve the model to better fit the requirements for the data at hand. For instance, one can choose from a number of parametric statistical distributions that are likely to fit the data (for counts, the Poisson or negative binomial distribution can be chosen, and for binary or proportional data, a binomial distribution is an obvious choice).\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/r_paired_t_test/","title":"Mixed model formulation of a paired t-test"},{"content":"Used packages library(ggplot2) ## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.0.2  library(lme4) ## Loading required package: Matrix  Dummy data For the sake of this demontration we use a very simple dataset with a very high signal versus noise ratio.

This indicates that we have either a poor model fit or zero-inflation.\nImproving the model In the case of this example we have two groups with very different means: one group with low mean generating lots of zero’s and one group with large mean generating no zero’s.

So this model can captures the zero’s and there is not zero-inflation. In case of the zero-inflated Poisson variable 0.0% of the simulated dataset from the complex model has more zero’s than the observed dataset. Hence we conclude that the zero’s are not modelled properly. We can’t improve the model further with covariates, hence we’ll have to treat is a a zero-inflated distribution.\nm.zero.zi \u0026lt;- zeroinfl( ZeroInflatedPoisson ~ factor(Mean) | 1, data = dataset, dist = \u0026#34;poisson\u0026#34; ) summary(m.zero.zi) ## ## Call: ## zeroinfl(formula = ZeroInflatedPoisson ~ factor(Mean) | 1, data = dataset, ## dist = \u0026quot;poisson\u0026quot;) ## ## Pearson residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.0282 -0.2126 -0.2126 0.3297 9.1506 ## ## Count model coefficients (poisson with log link): ## Estimate Std.

Is that all?\nYES :-)\nReally?\nYES :-)\nWell, hmmm, if you really want to know a little bit more…\nA GeoPackage can contain many layers. So, it is good practice to explicitly define the layer name within the GeoPackage (above, it was automatically called ‘sac’). For example:\nsac %\u0026gt;% st_write(\u0026#34;sac.gpkg\u0026#34;, layer = \u0026#34;special_areas_conservation\u0026#34;, delete_dsn = TRUE) ## Deleting source `sac.gpkg' using driver `GPKG' ## Writing layer `special_areas_conservation' to data source ## `sac.gpkg' using driver `GPKG' ## Writing 616 features with 4 fields and geometry type Polygon.  Note, delete_dsn was set as TRUE to replace the whole GeoPackage. (There is also a delete_layer argument to overwrite an existing layer with the same name.)\nLet’s extract a selection of features from the special_areas_conservation layer, and add it as a second layer into the GeoPackage file:\nsac %\u0026gt;% filter(str_detect(sac_name, \u0026#34;Turnhout\u0026#34;)) %\u0026gt;% # only polygons having \u0026#39;Turnhout\u0026#39; in their name field st_write(\u0026#34;sac.gpkg\u0026#34;, layer = \u0026#34;turnhout\u0026#34;) ## Writing layer `turnhout' to data source `sac.gpkg' using driver `GPKG' ## Writing 16 features with 4 fields and geometry type Polygon.

(2020), Pebesma \u0026amp; Bivand (2019) and Hijmans (2019), and from various websites.\nWhy use open standards?  Open file standards ease collaboration, portability and compatibility between users, machines and applications. Their (file) structure is fully documented.  Consequently, scientists and programmers can build new software / packages and make innovations that use these standards, while maintaining interoperability with existing applications. And, there is a much higher chance that your data will still be readable in a hundred years from now. The standard’s open documentation makes it relatively easy to build tools that can read an ancient open-standard file!    Luckily, quite a list of open standards is available! Below, some powerful and widely-used single-file formats are introduced. Single-file data sources are readily amenable to exchange and publication.\nI see you can’t wait to start practicing, so you can also head straight over to the tutorial on vector formats and the tutorial on raster formats! In these tutorials, a comparison table of vector/raster file formats is also presented.\nA few words on the GDAL library GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is by far the most used collection of open-source drivers for:\n a lot of raster formats; a lot of vector formats.  In other words, it is the preferred workhorse for reading and writing many geospatial file formats, used in the background by a lot of geospatial applications . Using GDAL is the easiest way to conform to open standards.\nSo, in R we use packages that use GDAL in the background, such as rgdal, sp, sf, raster and stars.\nThe GeoPackage file format  Its website is https://www.geopackage.org. It is a standardized implementation of an SQLite database for geospatial data. Hence, a GeoPackage is a binary file (filename.gpkg). It shares this property with shapefiles, which however pose multiple limitations,1 so the GeoPackage is a more than suitable replacement. The GeoPackage can store one or multiple vector layers (points, lines, polygons and related feature types). Besides vector data, it can also store raster data or extra standalone tables. These properties make it somehow comparable to the ‘personal geodatabase’ of ArcGIS – ESRI’s closed, Windows-only format.2 The GeoPackage standard is maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which stands out as a reference when it comes to open geospatial standards.  The GeoJSON file format  One GeoJSON file (filename.geojson) contains one vector layer. Note that one vector layer can combine different feature geometry types, e.g. points and linestrings. JSON itself is a common and straightforward open data format. It is a text file readable both by humans and machines (see the tutorial for an example). GeoJSON adds the necessary specification to JSON for standardized storage of geographic feature data, but it is still a plain JSON text file. The GeoJSON standard is maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a large open standards organization that develops Internet standards under the auspices of the Internet Society. Although the previous version of the GeoJSON standard – GeoJSON 2008 – is still a lot in use, it is obsoleted and a new version RFC7946 is establishing.  This version is strict about the coordinate reference system (CRS) – it is always WGS 84 – and it also differs on a few other aspects (such as the recommendation for applications not to inflate decimal coordinate precision). RFC7946 solves the problem that quite a few libraries – including GDAL – simply assumed WGS 84 in GeoJSON 2008 (without checking or transforming), even though WGS 84 was not a requirement of GeoJSON 2008 (it did support an explicit crs declaration). This resulted in inconveniences (cf. this post in the sf-repository). A specific section in the documentation of GDAL’s GeoJSON driver gives a summary of the differences between both GeoJSON versions.   While GDAL by default still follows the GeoJSON 2008 format,3 RFC7946 is supported by the option RFC7946=YES. Here, reprojection to WGS 84 will happen automatically. It applies 7 decimal places for coordinates, i.e. approximately 1 cm. Given the advantages, we advise to explicitly use RFC7946. Several functions in R allow the user to provide options that are passed to GDAL, so we can ask to deliver RFC7946 (see the tutorial). In order to keep it manageable (text file size, usage in versioning systems4 ) it can be wise to use GeoJSON for more simple cases (points and rather simple lines and polygons), and use the binary GeoPackage format for larger (more complex) cases.  The GeoTIFF file format  GeoTIFF is the preferred single-file open standard for raster data. It adheres to the open TIFF specification; hence it is a TIFF image file (filename.tif). It uses a small set of reserved TIFF tags to store information about CRS, extent and resolution of the raster. A GeoTIFF file can contain one or multiple rasters with the same CRS, extent and resolution. The GeoTIFF standard is maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which stands out as a reference when it comes to open geospatial standards.  Literature Hijmans R. (2019).

This code example creates an after update trigger for table Measurement. Columns UpdateDate and UpdateUser are updated on each update:  CREATE TRIGGER [dbo].[TR_Measurement_AU] ON [dbo].[Measurement] AFTER UPDATE AS BEGIN SET NOCOUNT ON; UPDATE t SET t.UpdateDate = GETDATE() , t.UpdateUser = SUSER_SNAME() FROM inserted i INNER JOIN Measurement t ON t.ID = i.ID; END Indexes  Indexes are used to speed up lookups and sorting. Do not use indexes to enforce uniqueness; use unique key constraint instead, which creates an index itself. Exception to this: when uniqueness is required in combination with a filtering criterium. As a rule of thumb create an index on each foreign key column. As a rule of thumb make sure that the primary key constraint uses a clustered index. Clustered indexes are created on DATA filegroup; non-clustered indexes on INDEXES filegroup. Leave the rest of the indexing up to the DBA. In order to help the DBA in choosing the correct indexes, explain him the (search and sorting) behaviour of the application. Performance issues might require the creation (or deletion) of indexes during the lifetime of the db. Indexes do not contribute to the versioning of the database. Naming: IN_\u0026lt;table name\u0026gt;_\u0026lt;specification\u0026gt; where specification describes function of index or columns included IN_Measurement_MeasurementStatusID for an index on the MeasurementStatusID column of the Measurement table. This example creates an index on the SpeciesID column of the Measurement table. Non-clustered indexes are always created on the INDEXES filegroup:  CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IN_Measurement_SpeciesID ON Measurement(SpeciesID) ON INDEXES;  Example on how to enforce the primary key using a clustered index. Clustered indexes ares always created on the DATA filegroup:  ALTER TABLE Measurement ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Measurement PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ID) ON DATA; Views  Stored queries. Views can be updatable. For creation of indexed views (e.g. on calculated columns) consult the DBA. Don\u0026rsquo;t use ORDER BY in views. Naming: VW_\u0026lt;logical name\u0026gt;, e.g.  VW_ActiveMesearumentStatus, retrieves the currently active measurement statusses    Synonyms  Do not use synonyms; they get the databases intertwined.  Stored procedures  no guidelines yet  Functions  no guidelines yet  Sequences  Use IDENTITY column instead of sequence to get an auto-increment behaviour at the table level. Use sequence to get an auto-increment behaviour across multiple tables (rare). Naming: SQ_\u0026lt;logical name\u0026gt;  Security  DBA\u0026rsquo;s task to implement security. Good to know how it\u0026rsquo;s normally implemented. Permissions are granted to database roles and users are assigned to database roles; the user gets the permissions of the database role to which it is assigned. Permissions are never granted to users When possible a user should be assigned to 1 database role only  Database Roles  following custom database roles per database:  DR_Admin: has dba permissions on the database; dba can be implement this using following steps  grant create permissions for all objects the dba wants to allow to be created (at database level), eg create table   grant alter any schema (at database level)     DR_\u0026lt;schema\u0026gt;_Admin: has dba permissions on the schema of the database; dba can be implement this using following steps  grant create permissions for all objects the dba wants to allow to be created (at database level), eg create table     grant alter (at \u0026lt;schema\u0026gt; level)   DR_Reader: has readonly (R) permissions on all tables and views DR_App\u0026lt;Application name\u0026gt;: has application specific permissions: developer determines which permissions should be applied on the individual tables DR_Rpt\u0026lt;Reporting name\u0026gt;   When required extra database roles can be provided  Users / Logins  The terms login (server level) and user (database level) are separate concepts in SQL Server; it\u0026rsquo;s the login that\u0026rsquo;s used in connection string; the login is mapped to a user at the database level; we map both 1 to 1 and refer to it as user. Each component of an application that interacts with the database needs its own, unique user:  unique at INBO level dedicated user : tracebility when an application uses multiple services, which interact with the db, each service should have its own user. when an application connects in different ways to the db (e.g. transactional vs reporting) each functional component should have its own user. the (application)user is assigned to the DR_Approle.

We join the information from the grid to the points through a left join. See the DE-9IM topological model for explanations about all possible spatial joins.\nNote that with st_intersects points on a polygon boundary and points corresponding to a polygon vertex are considered to be inside the polygon. In the case where points are joined with polygons, st_intersects and st_covered_by will give the same result. The join type st_within can be used if we want to join only when points are completely within (excluding polygon boundary).\ninvasive_be10grid_sf \u0026lt;- invasive_spatial %\u0026gt;% st_join(be10grid, join = st_intersects, left = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% select(-eoforigin, -noforigin) # exclude the EofOrigin NofOrigin columns Looking at selected columns of the resulting object:\ninvasive_be10grid_sf %\u0026gt;% select(species, eventDate, cellcode, geometry) ## Simple feature collection with 513 features and 3 fields ## Geometry type: POINT ## Dimension: XY ## Bounding box: xmin: 35125.7 ymin: 188235.3 xmax: 153743.2 ymax: 220135 ## Projected CRS: Belge 1972 / Belgian Lambert 72 ## # A tibble: 513 × 4 ## species eventDate cellcode geometry ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dttm\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;POINT [m]\u0026gt; ## 1 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-09-17 00:00:00 10kmE392N312 (143788.9 201487.1) ## 2 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-06-03 00:00:00 10kmE392N312 (143788.9 201487.1) ## 3 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-03-20 00:00:00 10kmE389N311 (114822.9 188235.3) ## 4 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-07-03 00:00:00 10kmE393N311 (153743.2 191634.8) ## 5 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-09-17 00:00:00 10kmE392N312 (143788.9 201487.1) ## 6 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-04-10 00:00:00 10kmE392N312 (147138.3 199035.5) ## 7 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-03-13 00:00:00 10kmE381N314 (35125.7 205808.5) ## 8 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-03-19 00:00:00 10kmE391N312 (136197.7 197300.8) ## 9 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-03-19 00:00:00 10kmE391N312 (136197.7 197300.8) ## 10 Eriocheir sinensis 2008-10-28 00:00:00 10kmE389N311 (121593.8 190203.2) ## # … with 503 more rows  Point in polygon with the sp package General note: migration to the more actively developed sf package is currently advised by the sp maintainer.

The spatialite database from the EEA website (with the 10 km x 10 km grid) still uses the older PROJ.4 string . Because the rgdal package is still backwards compatible, we should not (yet) worry about this: rgdal does the translation for the newer GDAL 3 and PROJ \u0026gt;= 6.

This column \u0026lsquo;dec\u0026rsquo; consists of the values of column mpg divided by 10. We selected the columns \u0026lsquo;mpg\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;dec\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;am\u0026rsquo; using select(). We filtered for the value \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; in the column \u0026lsquo;am\u0026rsquo; using filter().  And all of this in just one step! Now what?

It has some nice features which are still not available in the sync tools provided by Google. For the remaining of this tutorial, \u0026ldquo;GoogleDrive\u0026rdquo; refers to the sync tools provided by Google.\nThe problem with GoogleDrive GoogleDrive doesn\u0026rsquo;t work well in combination with RStudio projects or Git projects. We\u0026rsquo;ll illustrate the problem with RStudio. RStudio has a performant auto save functionality, which limits data loss after an unexpected crash. As soon as the user changes a few characters in a script, the auto save kicks in. This functionality stores the backup information into a hidden subdirectory of the project (.Rproj.user). It writes very often to the files in this subdirectory.\nGoogleDrive is constantly monitoring the synchronised directory for new, changed or deleted files. As soon as it detects such file, it will lock the file, synchronise the file and unlock the file. The locking of the file pervents that changes are made to the file while it is being synchronised, because this would mess up the synchronisation. GoogleDrive synchronises all files within a synced directory, including those created by the RStudio auto save function. But as this function writes very often to those files, it often ends in trying to write to a file which still is locked by GoogleDrive. This results in a \u0026ldquo;cannot save to file\u0026rdquo; dialog box in RStudio, which has to be dismissed by the user. This happens so often that it becomes frustrating for the user.\nHow Insync solves this problem Insync is also constantly monitoring all files in the synchronised directories. Unlike GoogleDrive, Insync has an option to ignore directories or files when synchronising. When Insync is set to ignore .Rproj.user, the files within .Rproj.user are no longer synchronised and thus never locked, causing no problem with the RStudio auto save function.\nWait a minute, so these files will be no longer be available through the GoogleDrive website? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that a problem? Indeed, they will not be available. And no, that is not a problem. Only your temporary changes are no longer synchronised. When you save your script file in RStudio, you are saving a file to a location which is not on the ignore list and will thus be synchronised. But after saving, this file will be locked during sync? Yes, but the time between two consecutive manual saves of a script is a lot larger that the time required to sync the script. So the file will be unlocked by the next time you save the file.\nHow to set the ignore list in Insync First of all, it is important to do this prior to syncing files to your computer. Once a file or directory has been synced between the computer and the cloud, Insync will keep syncing it. Even when a file or directory is afterward added to the ignore list.\nSet up  Open the Insync app Click on your avatar Choose ignore list Add the search pattern for the files/folders to ignore into the form fieldand click on the circled \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo;  The default action is to exclude all matching files and directories (including their files and subdirectories) from syncing (\u0026ldquo;do not upload or download\u0026rdquo;). Local files will remain only local and files in the cloud will remain only in the cloud. You can change this behaviour via the drop down menu of the pattern. Other options are \u0026ldquo;do not upload\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;do not download\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;remove from this list\u0026rdquo;.\nWe recommend to add following patterns:\n .rproj.user *.git *.rcheck *_cache *_files _site  FAQ  Can I use the same local folder when switching from GoogleDrive to Insync  It is safer you use a different folder.   I\u0026rsquo;ve already synced an RStudio project with Insync without setting the ignore list  Create a new RStudio project in a different folder and copy your data an script to this new RStudio project    ","href":"/tutorials/installation/user/user_install_insync/","title":"Insync installation"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/ci/","title":"ci"},{"content":"","href":"/tutorials/tags/development/","title":"development"},{"content":"Set up continuous integration with Wercker There are 2 major steps to set up continuous integration:\n create a wercker.yml file in the package add the application (package) to Wercker.com  To be able to add a package to Wercker, one must have administrator rights on the package repository on Github.\nThe Wercker test environment can only be set up if the file wercker.yml is commited to the repository, but Wercker is triggered to start checking when the application is added to wercker.com (giving an error if wercker.yml is not commited yet).\nwercker.yml Add a file \u0026ldquo;wercker.yml\u0026rdquo; in the root of the package with:\n box: reference to a package with a Docker image that is used as a test environment.

I’ve been teaching applied statistics to this audience for about a decade now, and this book has evolved from that experience. The book teaches generalized linear multilevel modeling (GLMMs) from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. The book covers the basics of regression through multilevel models, as well as touching on measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. This is not a traditional mathematical statistics book. Instead the approach is computational, using complete R code examples, aimed at developing skilled and skeptical scientists. Theory is explained through simulation exercises, using R code. And modeling examples are fully worked, with R code displayed within the main text.

Topics covered include linear and logistic regression, simple and complex ANOVA models (for factorial, nested, block, split-plot and repeated measures and covariance designs), and log-linear models. Multivariate techniques, including classification and ordination, are then introduced. Special emphasis is placed on checking assumptions, exploratory data analysis and presentation of results. The main analyses are illustrated with many examples from published papers and there is an extensive reference list to both the statistical and biological literature. The book is supported by a website that provides all data sets, questions for each chapter and links to software.\n  James et al. (2013): An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.\n  Emden (2008): The typical biology student is “hardwired” to be wary of any tasks involving the application of mathematics and statistical analyses, but the plain fact is much of biology requires interpretation of experimental data through the use of statistical methods. This unique textbook aims to demystify statistical formulae for the average biology student. Written in a lively and engaging style, Statistics for Terrified Biologists draws on the author’s 30 years of lecturing experience. One of the foremost entomologists of his generation, van Emden has an extensive track record for successfully teaching statistical methods to even the most guarded of biology students. For the first time basic methods are presented using straightforward, jargon-free language. Students are taught to use simple formulae accurately to interpret what is being measured with each test and statistic, while at the same time learning to recognize overall patterns and guiding principles. Complemented by simple illustrations and useful case studies, this is an ideal statistics resource tool for undergraduate biology and environmental science students who lack confidence in their mathematical abilities.\n  Agresti (2002): The use of statistical methods for categorical data has increased dramatically, particularly for applications in the biomedical and social sciences. Responding to new developments in the field as well as to the needs of a new generation of professionals and students, this new edition of the classic Categorical Data Analysis offers a comprehensive introduction to the most important methods for categorical data analysis. Designed for statisticians and biostatisticians as well as scientists and graduate students practicing statistics, Categorical Data Analysis, Second Edition summarizes the latest methods for univariate and correlated multivariate categorical responses. Readers will find a unified generalized linear models approach that connects logistic regression and Poisson and negative binomial regression for discrete data with normal regression for continuous data.\n  van Belle (2008): This book contains chapters titled:\n Begin with a Basic Formula for Sample Size–Lehr’s Equation Calculating Sample Size Using the Coefficient of Variation Ignore the Finite Population Correction in Calculating Sample Size for a Survey The Range of the Observations Provides Bounds for the Standard Deviation * Do not Formulate a Study Solely in Terms of Effect Size Overlapping Confidence Intervals do not Imply Nonsignificance Sample Size Calculation for the Poisson Distribution Sample Size Calculation for Poisson Distribution with Background Rate Sample Size Calculation for the Binomial Distribution When Unequal Sample Sizes Matter; When They Don’t * Determining Sample Size when there are Different Costs Associated with the Two Samples Use the Rule of Threes for 95% Upper Bounds when there Have Been No Events Sample Size Calculations Should be Based on the Way the Data will be Analyzed    Grolemund \u0026amp; Wickham (2016): This is the website for {“}R for Data Science{”}. This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.\n  Baddeley et al. (2015): Spatial Point Patterns: Methodology and Applications with R shows scientific researchers and applied statisticians from a wide range of fields how to analyze their spatial point pattern data. Making the techniques accessible to non-mathematicians, the authors draw on their 25 years of software development experiences, methodological research, and broad scientific collaborations to deliver a book that clearly and succinctly explains concepts and addresses real scientific questions. Practical Advice on Data Analysis and Guidance on the Validity and Applicability of Methods The first part of the book gives an introduction to R software, advice about collecting data, information about handling and manipulating data, and an accessible introduction to the basic concepts of point processes. The second part presents tools for exploratory data analysis, including non-parametric estimation of intensity, correlation, and spacing properties. The third part discusses model-fitting and statistical inference for point patterns. The final part describes point patterns with additional {“}structure,{”} such as complicated marks, space-time observations, three- and higher-dimensional spaces, replicated observations, and point patterns constrained to a network of lines. Easily Analyze Your Own Data Throughout the book, the authors use their spatstat package, which is free, open-source code written in the R language. This package provides a wide range of capabilities for spatial point pattern data, from basic data handling to advanced analytic tools. The book focuses on practical needs from the user’s perspective, offering answers to the most frequently asked questions in each chapter.\n  Hobbs \u0026amp; Hooten (2015): Bayesian modeling has become an indispensable tool for ecological research because it is uniquely suited to deal with complexity in a statistically coherent way. This textbook provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the latest Bayesian methods—in language ecologists can understand. Unlike other books on the subject, this one emphasizes the principles behind the computations, giving ecologists a big-picture understanding of how to implement this powerful statistical approach. Bayesian Models is an essential primer for non-statisticians. It begins with a definition of probability and develops a step-by-step sequence of connected ideas, including basic distribution theory, network diagrams, hierarchical models, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and inference from single and multiple models. This unique book places less emphasis on computer coding, favoring instead a concise presentation of the mathematical statistics needed to understand how and why Bayesian analysis works. It also explains how to write out properly formulated hierarchical Bayesian models and use them in computing, research papers, and proposals. This primer enables ecologists to understand the statistical principles behind Bayesian modeling and apply them to research, teaching, policy, and management.\n Presents the mathematical and statistical foundations of Bayesian modeling in language accessible to non-statisticians Covers basic distribution theory, network diagrams, hierarchical models, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and more - Deemphasizes computer coding in favor of basic principles Explains how to write out properly factored statistical expressions representing Bayesian models    Zuur et al. (2017): In Volume I we explain how to apply linear regression models, generalised linear models (GLM), and generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) to spatial, temporal, and spatial-temporal data. The models that will be employed use the Gaussian and gamma distributions for continuous data, the Poisson and negative binomial distributions for count data, the Bernoulli distribution for absence–presence data, and the binomial distribution for proportional data.In Volume II we apply zero-inflated models and generalised additive (mixed-effects) models to spatial and spatial-temporal data. We also discuss models with more exotic distributions like the generalised Poisson distribution to deal with underdispersion and the beta distribution to analyse proportional data.\n  Zuur et al. (2010):\n While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a randomsample of theirwork (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniquesemployed. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially trouble- somein applied ecology, wheremanagement and policy decisions are often at stake. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance ofmaking wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses. Key-words:    Kelleher \u0026amp; Wagener (2011): Our ability to visualize scientific data has evolved significantly over the last 40 years. However, this advancement does not necessarily alleviate many common pitfalls in visualization for scientific journals, which can inhibit the ability of readers to effectively understand the information presented. To address this issue within the context of visualizing environmental data, we list ten guidelines for effective data visualization in scientific publications. These guidelines support the primary objective of data visualization, i.e. to effectively convey information. We believe that this small set of guidelines based on a review of key visualization literature can help researchers improve the communication of their results using effective visualization. Enhancement of environmental data visualization will further improve research presentation and communication within and across disciplines.\n  Lohr (2010): Sharon L. Lohr’s SAMPLING: DESIGN AND ANALYSIS, 2ND EDITION, provides a modern introduction to the field of survey sampling intended for a wide audience of statistics students. Practical and authoritative, the book is listed as a standard reference for training on real-world survey problems by a number of prominent surveying organizations. Lohr concentrates on the statistical aspects of taking and analyzing a sample, incorporating a multitude of applications from a variety of disciplines. The text gives guidance on how to tell when a sample is valid or not, and how to design and analyze many different forms of sample surveys. Recent research on theoretical and applied aspects of sampling is included, as well as optional technology instructions for using statistical software with survey data.\n  Zuur et al. (2009): Building on the successful Analysing Ecological Data (Zuur et al., 2007), the authors now provide an expanded introduction to using regression and its extensions in analysing ecological data. As with the earlier book, real data sets from postgraduate ecological studies or research projects are used throughout. The first part of the book is a largely non-mathematical introduction to linear mixed effects modelling, GLM and GAM, zero inflated models, GEE, GLMM and GAMM. The second part provides ten case studies that range from koalas to deep sea research. These chapters provide an invaluable insight into analysing complex ecological datasets, including comparisons of different approaches to the same problem. By matching ecological questions and data structure to a case study, these chapters provide an excellent starting point to analysing your own data. Data and R code from all chapters are available from www.highstat.com.\n  Zuur \u0026amp; Ieno (2016):\n Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis ofmultifaceted interrelated datamake obtaining more accu- rate andmeaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data thatwill enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending themodel via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation ofwhatmay be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.    Gelman \u0026amp; Hill (2007): Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors’ own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout.\n  Lindenmayer \u0026amp; Likens (2010): Long-term monitoring programs are fundamental to understanding the natural environment and effectively tackling major environmental problems. Yet they are often done very poorly and ineffectively. Effective Ecological Monitoring describes what makes successful and unsuccessful long-term monitoring programs. Short and to the point, it illustrates key aspects with case studies and examples. It is based on the collective experience of running long-term research and monitoring programs of the two authors – experience which spans more than 70 years. The book first outlines why long-term monitoring is important, then discusses why long-term monitoring programs often fail. The authors then highlight what makes good and effective monitoring. These good and bad aspects of long-term monitoring programs are further illustrated in the fourth chapter of the book. The final chapter sums up the future of long-term monitoring programs and how to make them better, more effective and better targeted.\n  Bolker (2008): Ecological Models and Data in R is the first truly practical introduction to modern statistical methods for ecology. In step-by-step detail, the book teaches ecology graduate students and researchers everything they need to know in order to use maximum likelihood, information-theoretic, and Bayesian techniques to analyze their own data using the programming language R. Drawing on extensive experience teaching these techniques to graduate students in ecology, Benjamin Bolker shows how to choose among and construct statistical models for data, estimate their parameters and confidence limits, and interpret the results. The book also covers statistical frameworks, the philosophy of statistical modeling, and critical mathematical functions and probability distributions. It requires no programming background–only basic calculus and statistics.\n Practical, beginner-friendly introduction to modern statistical techniques for ecology using the programming language R Step-by-step instructions for fitting models to messy, real-world data Balanced view of different statistical approaches Wide coverage of techniques – from simple (distribution fitting) to complex (state-space modeling) Techniques for data manipulation and graphical display Companion Web site with data and R code for all examples    Bibliography Agresti A.

Double clicking on the error will open the file at the correct location, making it easy to rectify the problem.\nExtra hint: start correcting for the last lines and work your way forward. This leaves the line numbers of the errors intact until you solve them.\nAn example to clarify this. Suppose you have an error at line 10 and an error at line 100. Both errors are lines should not be more than 80 characters, so to solve them we have to split the lines over multiple lines.\nLet say that we start with solving line 10 by splitting it over four lines. So the old line 10 becomes the new lines 10 to 13. Hence the old line 11 becomes the new line 14, and the old line 100 becomes the new line 103. When we now click on the marker for line 100, RStudio will go the current line 100 which is the old line 97. So you end up looking for an error at the wrong position.\nStarting at the back solved this issue. In the same example we would start by solving line 100. Let’s assume we split this over two lines. So old line 100 because new line 100 and 101. Old line 101 becomes new line 102 but more importantly all line numbers before 100 are unchanged. So clicking on the marker for line 10 will take you the current line 10 which is the old line 10.\n# validate a single file lintr::lint(filename = \u0026#34;file.R\u0026#34;) lintr::lint(filename = \u0026#34;file.Rmd\u0026#34;) # validate a package lintr::lint_package(path = \u0026#34;.\u0026#34;) Documentation Functions  Add documentation above each function with Roxygen markup Add inline comments where relevant  Required Roxygen tags #\u0026#39; @title Title of the helpfile #\u0026#39; @description Description of the function in the helpfile #\u0026#39; @param define a parameter #\u0026#39; @export is the function exported by the package NAMESPACE #\u0026#39; @importFrom import a function from another package Optional Roxygen tags #\u0026#39; @seealso link to other functions #\u0026#39; @section section title #\u0026#39; @alias other name for the topic #\u0026#39; @keywords a set of standardised keywords.

Access this data with system.file(\u0026quot;xyz\u0026quot;, package = \u0026quot;abc\u0026quot;). Possible for all data types. to make data available to package users, store them in the data folder. Access this data with data(xyz). Possible only for data formats that can be handled by data(). Binary .rda-files can be stored by using usethis::use_data(xyz). to keep data internal for use by your functions, store them in the file R/Sysdata.rda by using usethis::use_data(xyz, internal = TRUE). Access this data with abc::xyz.  (In the above examples, xyz are data and abc is the package in which they are stored.)\nAdd scripts for generating these data in the folder data-raw and create this folder by using usethis::use_data_raw() (ignores folder during build).\nR script  group a long set of commands with similar functionality into a dedicated function  e.g. prepare_data(), do_analysis(), create_figure(), …   place the user defined functions in a separate file which you source() into the main script  it is better to use the same file structure as an R package consider writing a simple package in case you have a lot of functions    RMarkdown  each chunk has only one output (figure, table, summary, …) don’t mix (heavy) calculations and output in the same chunk: this is more interesting for caching the results give chunks a relevant name: this make debugging easier and file name of figures and Bookdown label will be based on the chunk name avoid writing code that generates Markdown  use (parametrised) child documents instead   use the bookdown version for long reports: this makes it easy to split a long report into several child documents  Recommended packages Data import  readr: import text files readxl: import Excel files googlesheets: import Google Sheets DBI: connect to databases PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Oracle, … RODBC: connect to databases SQL Server, Access  Data manipulation \u0026amp; transformation  dplyr:  subsetting observations subsetting variables changing variables aggregation combining dataframes   tidyr:  changing a dataframe from wide to long format and vice versa nesting and unnesting dataframes splitting a single variable into multiple variables    Graphics  ggplot2:all static graphics, charts and plots INBOtheme: INBO corporate identity for ggplot2 graphics  Quality control  lintr: checking coding style testthat: writing unit tests covr: check which part of the code is not covered by unit tests  ","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/styleguide_r_code/","title":"Styleguide R code"},{"content":"Na de eerste installatie  Start Rstudio Kies in het menu Tools -\u0026gt; Global Options In het tabblad General  Pas de Default working directory aan naar de locatie waar je R versie staat (C:/R/R-4.x.y) 1 Restore .RData into workspace at startup: uitvinken Save workspace to.RData on exit: Never   In het tabblad Code  Subtab Editing  Insert spaces for tab: aanvinken Tab width: 2 Soft-wrap R source files: aanvinken   Subtab Saving  Default text encoding: UTF-8   Subtab Diagnostics  Alles aanvinken     In het tabblad Appearance  Stel in naar eigen smaak   In het tabblad Packages  CRAN mirror: wijzigen naar Global (CDN) - RStudio   In het tabblad Sweave  Weave Rnw files using: knitr Typeset LaTeX into PDF using: XeLaTex   Klik op OK en herstart RStudio  Configuratie van RStudio na een upgrade van R  Start RStudio Kies in het menu Tools -\u0026gt; Global Options Indien niet de laatste versie vermeld staat bij R version: klik op Change om het aan te passen.

No worries, erroneous commits can be undone or reverted.\nFirst, check your history of commits to see which commits are the faulty ones.\ngit log --oneline Example output\nb7119f2 Continue doing crazy things 872fa7e Try something crazy a1e8fb5 Make some important changes to hello.py 435b61d Create hello.py 9773e52 Initial import Git checkout The git checkout command serves three distinct functions: checking out files, checking out commits, and checking out branches. In this part, only the first two configurations are addressed. Checking out a commit makes the entire working directory match that commit. This can be used to view an old state of your project without altering your current state in any way. Checking out a file lets you see an old version of that particular file, leaving the rest of your working directory untouched. (This will put you in a detached HEAD state.)\nYou can use git checkout to view the “Make some import changes to hello.py” commit as follows:\ngit checkout a1e8fb5 This makes your working directory match the exact state of the a1e8fb5 commit. You can look at files, and even edit files without worrying about losing the current state of the project. Nothing you do in here will be saved in your repository. Checking out an old commit is a read-only operation. It’s impossible to harm your repository while viewing an old revision. To continue developing, you need to get back to the “current” state of your project (assuming your master branch is the head of the project):\ngit checkout master If you’re only interested in a single file, you can also use git checkout to fetch an old version of it. For example, if you only wanted to see the hello.py file from the old commit, you could use the following command:\ngit checkout a1e8fb5 hello.py Remember, unlike checking out a commit, this does affect the current state of your project. The old file revision will show up as a “Change to be committed,” giving you the opportunity to revert back to the previous version of the file. If you decide you don’t want to keep the old version, you can check out the most recent version with the following:\ngit checkout HEAD hello.py This concludes the part on checking your previous commits. In the following part, some methods of rollback to a previous state will be elucidated.\ngit revert The git revert command undoes a committed snapshot. But, instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to undo the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting content. This prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration.\nUsage:\ngit revert \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; Generate a new commit that undoes all of the changes introduced in , then apply it to the current branch.\nReverting should be used when you want to remove an entire commit from your project history. This can be useful, for example, if you’re tracking down a bug and find that it was introduced by a single commit. Instead of manually going in, fixing it, and committing a new snapshot, you can use git revert to automatically do all of this for you.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that git revert undoes a single commit—it does not “revert” back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits. In Git, this is actually called a reset, not a revert.\nReverting has two important advantages over resetting. First, it doesn’t change the project history, which makes it a “safe” operation for commits that have already been published to a shared repository. For details about why altering shared history is dangerous, please see the git reset page.\nSecond, git revert is able to target an individual commit at an arbitrary point in the history, whereas git reset can only work backwards from the current commit. For example, if you wanted to undo an old commit with git reset, you would have to remove all of the commits that occurred after the target commit, remove it, then re-commit all of the subsequent commits. Needless to say, this is not an elegant undo solution.\nExample\nThe following example is a simple demonstration of git revert. It commits a snapshot, then immediately undoes it with a revert.\n// edit some tracked files // commit a snapshot git commit -m 'make some changes that will be undone' // revert the commit we have just created git revert HEAD This can be visualized as the following:\nNote that the 4th commit is still in the project history after the revert. Instead of deleting it, git revert added a new commit to undo its changes. As a result, the 3rd and 5th commits represent the exact same code base, and the 4th commit is still in our history just in case we want to go back to it down the road.\ngit reset If git revert is a “safe” way to undo changes, you can think of git reset as the dangerous method. When you undo with git reset(and the commits are no longer referenced by any ref or the reflog), there is no way to retrieve the original copy—it is a permanent undo. Care must be taken when using this tool, as it’s one of the only Git commands that has the potential to lose your work.\nLike git checkout, git reset is a versatile command with many configurations. It can be used to remove committed snapshots, although it’s more often used to undo changes in the staging area and the working directory. In either case, it should only be used to undo local changes—you should never reset snapshots that have been shared with other developers.\nUsage:\ngit reset \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; Remove the specified file from the staging area, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes.\ngit reset Reset the staging area to match the most recent commit, but leave the working directory unchanged. This unstages all files without overwriting any changes, giving you the opportunity to re-build the staged snapshot from scratch.\ngit reset --hard Reset the staging area and the working directory to match the most recent commit. In addition to unstaging changes, the \u0026ndash;hard flag tells Git to overwrite all changes in the working directory, too. Put another way: this obliterates all uncommitted changes, so make sure you really want to throw away your local developments before using it.\ngit reset \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; Move the current branch tip backward to , reset the staging area to match, but leave the working directory alone. All changes made since will reside in the working directory, which lets you re-commit the project history using cleaner, more atomic snapshots.\ngit reset --hard \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; Move the current branch tip backward to and reset both the staging area and the working directory to match. This obliterates not only the uncommitted changes, but all commits after , as well.\nDiscussion\nAll of the above invocations are used to remove changes from a repository. Without the \u0026ndash;hard flag, git reset is a way to clean up a repository by unstaging changes or uncommitting a series of snapshots and re-building them from scratch. The \u0026ndash;hard flag comes in handy when an experiment has gone horribly wrong and you need a clean slate to work with.\nWhereas reverting is designed to safely undo a public commit, git reset is designed to undo local changes. Because of their distinct goals, the two commands are implemented differently: resetting completely removes a changeset, whereas reverting maintains the original changeset and uses a new commit to apply the undo.\nDon’t Reset Public History\nYou should never use git reset when any snapshots after have been pushed to a public repository. After publishing a commit, you have to assume that other developers are reliant upon it.\nRemoving a commit that other team members have continued developing poses serious problems for collaboration. When they try to sync up with your repository, it will look like a chunk of the project history abruptly disappeared. The sequence below demonstrates what happens when you try to reset a public commit. The origin/master branch is the central repository’s version of your local master branch.\nAs soon as you add new commits after the reset, Git will think that your local history has diverged from origin/master, and the merge commit required to synchronize your repositories is likely to confuse and frustrate your team.\nThe point is, make sure that you’re using git reset on a local experiment that went wrong—not on published changes. If you need to fix a public commit, the git revert command was designed specifically for this purpose.\nExamples: unstaging a file The git reset command is frequently encountered while preparing the staged snapshot. The next example assumes you have two files called hello.py and main.py that you’ve already added to the repository.\n# Edit both hello.py and main.py # Stage everything in the current directory git add . # Realize that the changes in hello.py and main.py # should be committed in different snapshots # Unstage main.py git reset main.py # Commit only hello.py git commit -m \u0026quot;Make some changes to hello.py\u0026quot; # Commit main.py in a separate snapshot git add main.py git commit -m \u0026quot;Edit main.py\u0026quot; As you can see, git reset helps you keep your commits highly-focused by letting you unstage changes that aren’t related to the next commit.\nremoving local commits The next example shows a more advanced use case. It demonstrates what happens when you’ve been working on a new experiment for a while, but decide to completely throw it away after committing a few snapshots.\n# Create a new file called `foo.py` and add some code to it # Commit it to the project history git add foo.py git commit -m \u0026quot;Start developing a crazy feature\u0026quot; # Edit `foo.py` again and change some other tracked files, too # Commit another snapshot git commit -a -m \u0026quot;Continue my crazy feature\u0026quot; # Decide to scrap the feature and remove the associated commits git reset --hard HEAD~2 The git reset HEAD~2 command moves the current branch backward by two commits, effectively removing the two snapshots we just created from the project history. Remember that this kind of reset should only be used on unpublished commits. Never perform the above operation if you’ve already pushed your commits to a shared repository.\nUsage statement The content of this Rmarkdown tutorial is a transformation from this source and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Australia License.\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/git_undo_commit/","title":"Undo a git commit"},{"content":"When working off line, two Git tasks cannot be performed: fetching/pulling updates from the server, and pushing changes to the server.

Here we will explore some tips that make working with such files in R less painfull.\ntl;dr  If you can comfortably work with the entire file in memory, but reading the file is rather slow, consider using the data.table package and read the file with its fread function. If your file does not comfortably fit in memory:  Use sqldf if you have to stick to csv files. Use a SQLite database and query it using either SQL queries or dplyr. Convert your csv file to a sqlite database in order to query    Downloading the example files While you can directly test this tutorial on your own large data files, we will use bird tracking data from the LifeWatch bird tracking network for the examples. We have made two versions of some tracking data available for download: a .csv file (text data) and a .db file (sqlite data). Both contain processed log files; for more information on the processing, see the BirdTrackingEtl package.\ncsv.name \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;2016-04-20-processed-logs-big-file-example.csv\u0026#34; db.name \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;2016-04-20-processed-logs-big-file-example.db\u0026#34; The evaluation of the next code chunk is ignored by default as the downloading and unzipping of the files results in more than 3 GB of data. If you do want to download the files yourself and test the other chunks, run the code and download the csv and sqlite examples. Make sure you have the R.utils package available (for unzipping the downloaded files). If not, use the command install.packages(\u0026quot;R.utils\u0026quot;) in your R console to download the package.\nlibrary(\u0026#34;R.utils\u0026#34;) # download the CSV file example csv.url \u0026lt;- paste(\u0026#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lw-birdtracking-data/\u0026#34;, csv.name, \u0026#34;.gz\u0026#34;, sep = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) if (!file.exists(csv.name)) { download.file(csv.url, destfile = paste0(csv.name, \u0026#34;.gz\u0026#34;)) gunzip(paste0(csv.name, \u0026#34;.gz\u0026#34;)) } # download the sqlite database example db.url \u0026lt;- paste(\u0026#34;https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lw-birdtracking-data/\u0026#34;, db.name, \u0026#34;.gz\u0026#34;, sep = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) if (!file.exists(db.name)) { download.file(db.url, destfile = paste0(db.name, \u0026#34;.gz\u0026#34;)) gunzip(paste0(db.name, \u0026#34;.gz\u0026#34;)) } Loading a large dataset: use fread() or functions from readr instead of read.xxx(). library(\u0026#34;data.table\u0026#34;) library(\u0026#34;readr\u0026#34;) If you really need to read an entire csv in memory, by default, R users use the read.table method or variations thereof (such as read.csv). However, fread from the data.table package is a lot faster. Furthermore, the readr package also provides more optimized reading functions (read_csv, read_delim,…). Let’s measure the time to read in the data using these three different methods.\nread.table.timing \u0026lt;- system.time(read.table(csv.name, header = TRUE, sep = \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;)) readr.timing \u0026lt;- system.time(read_delim(csv.name, \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, col_names = TRUE)) data.table.timing \u0026lt;- system.time(allData \u0026lt;- fread(csv.name, showProgress = FALSE)) data \u0026lt;- data.frame(method = c(\u0026#39;read.table\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;readr\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;fread\u0026#39;), timing = c(read.table.timing[3], readr.timing[3], data.table.timing[3])) data ## method timing ## 1 read.table 183.732 ## 2 readr 3.625 ## 3 fread 12.564  fread and read_delim are indeed much faster then the default read.table. However, the result of fread is a data.table and the result of read_delim is a tibble. Both are not a data.frame. The data.table package describes the data.table object as a more performant replacement for the data.frame. This means that selecting, filtering and aggregating data is much faster on a data.table compared to the standard data.frame but it requires you to use a slightly different syntax. A tibble is very similar to a data.frame, but provides more convenience when printing or subsetting the data table.\nYou can find the data.table package on CRAN. A good place to learn this package are the package vignettes. The introduction to data.table should be enough to get started. The readr package is also on CRAN. It belongs to a suite of R packages aiming to improve data manipulation in R, called tidyverse. More examples and explanation about readr is provided on the readr website.\nData files that don’t fit in memory If you are not able to read in the data file, because it does not fit in memory (or because R becomes too slow when you load the entire dataset), you will need to limit the amount of data that will actually be stored in memory. There are a couple of options which we will investigate:\n limit the number of lines you are trying to read for some exploratory analysis. Once you are happy with the analysis you want to run on the entire dataset, move to another machine. limit the number of columns you are reading to reduce the memory required to store the data. limit both the number of rows and the number of columns using sqldf. stream the data.  1. Limit the number of lines you read (fread) Limiting the number of lines you read is easy. Just use the nrows and/or skip option (available to both read.table and fread). skip can be used to skip a number of rows, but you can also pass a string to this parameter causing fread to only start reading lines from the first line matching that string. Let’s say we only want to start reading lines after we find a line matching the pattern 2015-06-12 15:14:39. We can do that like this:\nsprintf(\u0026#34;Number of lines in full data set: %s\u0026#34;, nrow(allData)) ## [1] \u0026quot;Number of lines in full data set: 3761058\u0026quot;  subSet \u0026lt;- fread(csv.name, skip = \u0026#34;2015-06-12 15:14:39\u0026#34;, showProgress = FALSE) sprintf(\u0026#34;Number of lines in data set with skipped lines: %s\u0026#34;, nrow(subSet)) ## [1] \u0026quot;Number of lines in data set with skipped lines: 9998\u0026quot;  Skipping rows this way is obviously not giving you the entire dataset, so this strategy is only useful for doing exploratory analysis on a subset of your data. Note that also read_delim provides a n_max argument to limit the number of lines to read. If you want to explore the whole dataset, limiting the number of columns you read can be a more useful strategy.\n2. Limit the number of columns you read (fread) If you only need 4 columns of the 21 columns present in the file, you can tell fread to only select those 4. This can have a major impact on the memory footprint of your data. The option you need for this is: select. With this, you can specify a number of columns to keep. The opposite - specifying the columns you want to drop - can be accomplished with the drop option.\nfourColumns = fread(csv.name, select = c(\u0026#34;device_info_serial\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date_time\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;latitude\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;longitude\u0026#34;), showProgress = FALSE) sprintf(\u0026#34;Size of total data in memory: %s MB\u0026#34;, utils::object.size(allData)/1000000) ## [1] \u0026quot;Size of total data in memory: 1173.480728 MB\u0026quot;  sprintf(\u0026#34;Size of only four columns in memory: %s MB\u0026#34;, utils::object.size(fourColumns)/1000000) ## [1] \u0026quot;Size of only four columns in memory: 105.311936 MB\u0026quot;  The difference might not be as large as you would expect. R objects claim more memory than needed to store the data alone, as they keep pointers, and other object attributes. But still, the difference could save you.\n3. Limiting both the number of rows and the number of columns using sqldf The sqldf package allows you to run SQL-like queries on a file, resulting in only a selection of the file being read. It allows you to limit both the number of lines and the number of rows at the same time. In the background, this actually creates a sqlite database on the fly to execute the query. Consider using the package when starting from a csv file, but the actual strategy boils down to making a sqlite database file of your data. See this section below to learn how to interact with those and create a SQlite database from a CSV-file.\n4. Streaming data Short: streaming a file in R is a bad idea. If you are interested why, read the rest of this section.\nStreaming a file means reading it line by line and only keeping the lines you need or do stuff with the lines while you read through the file. It turns out that R is really not very efficient in streaming files. The main reason is the memory allocation process that has difficulties with a constantly growing object (which can be a dataframe containing only the selected lines).\nIn the next code block, we will read parts of our data file once using the freadfunction, and once line by line. You’ll see the performance issue with the streaming solution.\nlibrary(ggplot2) allowedDevices = c(753, 801, 852) minDate = strptime(\u0026#39;1/3/2014\u0026#39;,format = \u0026#39;%d/%m/%Y\u0026#39;) maxDate = strptime(\u0026#39;1/10/2014\u0026#39;,format = \u0026#39;%d/%m/%Y\u0026#39;) streamFile \u0026lt;- function(limit) { con \u0026lt;- file(csv.name, open = \u0026#34;r\u0026#34;) selectedRecords \u0026lt;- list() i \u0026lt;- 0 file.streaming.timing \u0026lt;- system.time( while (i \u0026lt; limit) { oneLine \u0026lt;- readLines(con, n = 1, warn = FALSE) vec = (strsplit(oneLine, \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;)) selectedRecords \u0026lt;- c(selectedRecords, vec) i \u0026lt;- i + 1 } ) close(con) return(file.streaming.timing[[3]]) } freadFile \u0026lt;- function(limit) { file.fread.timing = system.time( d \u0026lt;- fread(csv.name, showProgress = FALSE, nrows = limit) ) return(file.fread.timing[[3]]) } maxLines \u0026lt;- c(5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000) streamingTimes \u0026lt;- sapply(maxLines, streamFile) freadTimes \u0026lt;- sapply(maxLines, freadFile) data \u0026lt;- data.frame(n = maxLines, streaming = streamingTimes, fread = freadTimes) pdata \u0026lt;- melt(data, id = c(\u0026#34;n\u0026#34;)) colnames(pdata) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#34;n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;algorithm\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;execTime\u0026#34;) qplot(n, execTime, data = pdata, color = algorithm, xlab = \u0026#34;number of lines read\u0026#34;, ylab = \u0026#34;execution time (s)\u0026#34;) The database file strategy Working with SQLite databases SQLite databases are single file databases meaning you can simply download them, store them in a folder or share them with colleagues. Similar to a csv. They are however more powerful than csv’s because of two important features:\n Support for SQL: this allows you to execute intelligent filters on your data, similar to the sqldf package or database environments you are familiar with. That way, you can reduce the amount of data that’s stored in memory by filtering out rows or columns. Indexes: SQLite databases contain indexes. An index is something like an ordered version of a column. When enabled on a column, you can search through the column much faster. We will demonstrate this below.  We have downloaded a second file 2016-04-20-processed-logs-big-file-example.db that contains the same data as the 2016-04-20-processed-logs-big-file-example.csv file, but as a sqlite database. Furthermore, the database file contains indexes which will dramatically drop the time needed to perform search queries. If you do not have a SQLite database containing your data, you can first convert your csv into a SQlite as described further in this tutorial.\nLet’s first connect to the database and list the available tables.\nlibrary(RSQLite) db \u0026lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = db.name) # show the tables in this database dbListTables(db) ## [1] \u0026quot;SpatialIndex\u0026quot; \u0026quot;geom_cols_ref_sys\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;geometry_columns\u0026quot; \u0026quot;geometry_columns_auth\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;geometry_columns_field_infos\u0026quot; \u0026quot;geometry_columns_statistics\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;geometry_columns_time\u0026quot; \u0026quot;processed_logs\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;spatial_ref_sys\u0026quot; \u0026quot;spatialite_history\u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;sql_statements_log\u0026quot; \u0026quot;sqlite_sequence\u0026quot; ## [13] \u0026quot;vector_layers\u0026quot; \u0026quot;vector_layers_auth\u0026quot; ## [15] \u0026quot;vector_layers_field_infos\u0026quot; \u0026quot;vector_layers_statistics\u0026quot; ## [17] \u0026quot;views_geometry_columns\u0026quot; \u0026quot;views_geometry_columns_auth\u0026quot; ## [19] \u0026quot;views_geometry_columns_field_infos\u0026quot; \u0026quot;views_geometry_columns_statistics\u0026quot; ## [21] \u0026quot;virts_geometry_columns\u0026quot; \u0026quot;virts_geometry_columns_auth\u0026quot; ## [23] \u0026quot;virts_geometry_columns_field_infos\u0026quot; \u0026quot;virts_geometry_columns_statistics\u0026quot;  Let’s try to select rows where the device id matches a given value (e.g. 860), and the date time is between two given timestamps. For our analysis, we only need date_time, latitude, longitude and altitude so we will only select those.\nsqlTiming \u0026lt;- system.time(data \u0026lt;- dbGetQuery(conn = db, \u0026#34;SELECT date_time, latitude, longitude, altitude FROM processed_logs WHERE device_info_serial = 860 AND date_time \u0026lt; \u0026#39;2014-07-01\u0026#39; AND date_time \u0026gt; \u0026#39;2014-03-01\u0026#39;\u0026#34; )) print(sqlTiming[3]) ## elapsed ## 40.405  This provides a convenient and fast way to request subsets of data from our large data file. We could do the same analysis for each of the serial numbers, each time only loading that subset of the data. As an example, consider the calculation of the average altitude over the specified period for each of the bird serial identifiers in the list serial_id_list. By using a for loop, the calculation is done for each of the birds separately and the amount of data loaded into memory at the same time is lower:\nserial_id_list \u0026lt;- c(853, 860, 783) print(\u0026#34;Average altitude between 2014-03-01 and 2014-07-01:\u0026#34;) ## [1] \u0026quot;Average altitude between 2014-03-01 and 2014-07-01:\u0026quot;  for (serialid in serial_id_list) { data \u0026lt;- dbGetQuery(conn = db, sprintf(\u0026#34;SELECT date_time, latitude, longitude, altitude FROM processed_logs WHERE device_info_serial = %d AND date_time \u0026lt; \u0026#39;2014-07-01\u0026#39; AND date_time \u0026gt; \u0026#39;2014-03-01\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, serialid)) print(sprintf(\u0026#34;serialID %d: %f\u0026#34;, serialid, mean(data$altitude))) } ## [1] \u0026quot;serialID 853: NA\u0026quot; ## [1] \u0026quot;serialID 860: 23.550518\u0026quot; ## [1] \u0026quot;serialID 783: 14.900030\u0026quot;  Remark that we use the sprintf function to dynamically replace the serial id in the sqlite query we will execute. For each loop, the %d is replaced by the value of the serial id of the respective loop. Read the manual of the sprintf function for more information and options.\nInteracting with SQLite databases using dplyr If you’re not comfortable with writing queries in SQL, R has a great alternative: dplyr. dplyr can connect to a SQLite database and you can perform the same operations on it that you would do on a dataframe. However, dplyr will translate your commands to SQL, allowing you to take advantage of the indexes in the SQLite database.\nlibrary(dplyr) my_db \u0026lt;- src_sqlite(db.name, create = FALSE) bird_tracking \u0026lt;- tbl(my_db, \u0026#34;processed_logs\u0026#34;) results \u0026lt;- bird_tracking %\u0026gt;% filter(device_info_serial == 860) %\u0026gt;% select(date_time, latitude, longitude, altitude) %\u0026gt;% filter(date_time \u0026lt; \u0026#34;2014-07-01\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% filter(date_time \u0026gt; \u0026#34;2014-03-01\u0026#34;) head(results) ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 4] ## # Database: sqlite 3.36.0 ## # [/Users/peter_desmet/Coding/Repositories/inbo/tutorials/content/tutorials/r_large_data_files_handling/2016-04-20-processed-logs-big-file-example.db] ## date_time latitude longitude altitude ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 2014-03-10 12:43:37 44.0 -7.59 626 ## 2 2014-03-10 12:58:32 44.1 -7.67 405 ## 3 2014-03-10 13:13:52 44.1 -7.69 326 ## 4 2014-03-10 13:28:57 44.1 -7.71 250 ## 5 2014-03-10 13:43:54 44.1 -7.72 174 ## 6 2014-03-10 13:59:06 44.1 -7.73 23  Dplyr provides the ability to perform queries as above without the need to know SQL. If you want to learn more about how to use dplyr with a SQLite database, head over to this vignette.\nCreate a SQLite database from a CSV file In the case you have a CSV file available and you would like to query the data using SQL queries or with dplyr as shown in the previous sections, you can decide to convert the data to a SQlite database. The conversion will require some time, but once available, it provides the opportunity to query the data using SQL queries or with dplyr as shown in the previous sections. Moreover, you can easily add additional tables with related information to combine the data with.\nIf you already loaded the CSV file into memory, the creation of a SQLITE database is very straighforward and can be achieved in two steps:\ndb \u0026lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = \u0026#34;example.sqlite\u0026#34;) dbWriteTable(db, \u0026#34;birdtracks\u0026#34;, allData) dbDisconnect(db) The first command creates a new database when the file example.sqlite does not exist already. The command dbWriteTable writes the table in the database. Hence, we can rerun the query from the previous section, but now on the newly created SQlite database, with the single created table birdtracks:\nmy_db \u0026lt;- src_sqlite(\u0026#34;example.sqlite\u0026#34;, create = FALSE) bird_tracking \u0026lt;- tbl(my_db, \u0026#34;birdtracks\u0026#34;) results \u0026lt;- bird_tracking %\u0026gt;% filter(device_info_serial == 860) %\u0026gt;% select(date_time, latitude, longitude, altitude) %\u0026gt;% filter(date_time \u0026lt; \u0026#34;2014-07-01\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% filter(date_time \u0026gt; \u0026#34;2014-03-01\u0026#34;) head(results) ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 4] ## # Database: sqlite 3.36.0 ## # [/Users/peter_desmet/Coding/Repositories/inbo/tutorials/content/tutorials/r_large_data_files_handling/example.sqlite] ## # … with 4 variables: date_time \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, latitude \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, longitude \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, ## # altitude \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;  However, when working with really large CSV files, you do not want to load the entire file into memory first (this is the whole point of this tutorial). An alternative strategy is to load the data from the CSV file in chunks (small sections) and write them step by step to the SQlite database.\nThis can be implemented by reading the CSV file in small sections (let’s say 50000 lines each time) and move all sections to a given table in a sqlite database. As this is a recurrent task, we will provide the transformation in a custom written function, called csv_to_sqlite. The function is available within the inborutils package. Check the function documentation online or by typing ?csv_to_sqlite after installing and loading the inborutils package. As SQlite does not natively support date and datetime representations, the function converts those columns to an appropriate string representation before copying the dates to sqlite. To check for the date handling, the lubridate package is used.\nAs an example, let’s convert the processed bird logs csv file to a sqlite database, called example.sqlite as a table birdtracks. Using the default values for the preprocessing number of lines and the chunk size, the conversion is as follows:\nlibrary(inborutils) sqlite_file \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;example2.sqlite\u0026#34; table_name \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;birdtracks\u0026#34; inborutils::csv_to_sqlite(csv_file = csv.name, sqlite_file, table_name, pre_process_size = 1000, chunk_size = 50000, show_progress_bar = FALSE) Hence, this approach will work for large files as well and is an ideal first step when doing this kind of analysis. Once performed, the SQlite database is available to query, similar to the previous examples:\nmy_db \u0026lt;- src_sqlite(\u0026#34;example2.sqlite\u0026#34;, create = FALSE) ## Warning: `src_sqlite()` was deprecated in dplyr 1.0.0. ## Please use `tbl()` directly with a database connection ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated.  bird_tracking \u0026lt;- tbl(my_db, \u0026#34;birdtracks\u0026#34;) results \u0026lt;- bird_tracking %\u0026gt;% filter(device_info_serial == 860) %\u0026gt;% select(date_time, latitude, longitude, altitude) %\u0026gt;% filter(date_time \u0026lt; \u0026#34;2014-07-01\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% filter(date_time \u0026gt; \u0026#34;2014-03-01\u0026#34;) head(results) ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 4] ## # Database: sqlite 3.36.0 ## # [/Users/peter_desmet/Coding/Repositories/inbo/tutorials/content/tutorials/r_large_data_files_handling/example2.sqlite] ## date_time latitude longitude altitude ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 2014-03-10 12:43:37 44.0 -7.59 626 ## 2 2014-03-10 12:58:32 44.1 -7.67 405 ## 3 2014-03-10 13:13:52 44.1 -7.69 326 ## 4 2014-03-10 13:28:57 44.1 -7.71 250 ## 5 2014-03-10 13:43:54 44.1 -7.72 174 ## 6 2014-03-10 13:59:06 44.1 -7.73 23  Remark that the dates are properly handled, by making sure the date representation inside SQlite is the converted string version.\n","href":"/tutorials/tutorials/r_large_data_files_handling/","title":"Reading large data files in R"},{"content":"Connection to INBO database Here we provide the approach using the package DBI, which is also used by RStudio.[1]. This package enables the link between R and the (remote) database. After installation of the needed packages (install.packages(c(\u0026quot;DBI\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;glue\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;))), the packages can be loaded:\nlibrary(DBI) library(glue) library(tidyverse) To create a database connection, different approaches are available as explained in the next section:\n Use the dedicated connect_inbo_dbase function in the inbodb package Setup the required parameters yourself Reuse existing registered connections on your computer  Inbodb function To support the connection to INBO databases, a dedicated function is available in the inbodb package, called connect_inbo_dbase. The function provides support to connect to INBO databases and uses the Connections pane in the Rstudio interface:\nTo use the connect_inbo_dbase function, make sure to install the inbodb package, following the installation instructions. After a successfull installation, load the library and create a database connection:\nlibrary(inbodb) my_connection \u0026lt;- connect_inbo_dbase(\u0026#34;D0021_00_userFlora\u0026#34;) Once the connection is successfully established, the database can be queried.\nRemark for Linux users: When working in Linux, this setup (using Trusted connection) requires an active kerberos session. More information about the setup and functionality is to be found in the tutorial on kerberos installation.\nSetting up the connection yourself In case you want to setup the connection yourself (e.g. errors using inbodb), you can do so by providing the necessary parameters:\nmy_connection \u0026lt;- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), driver = \u0026#34;ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\u0026#34;, server = \u0026#34;inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be\u0026#34;, # or inbo-sql08-prd.inbo.be port = 1433, database = \u0026#34;D0021_00_userFlora\u0026#34;, # or your database of interest trusted_connection = \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34;) The most important parameters are server and database, the others should normally be kept as such (except for maybe driver). For the first one, remember that database names starting with M, S or W can be accessed using the inbo-sql08-prd.inbo.be server and others (mostly with D) use the inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be server. The database name is the name of the database (if you can’t remember the name, connect with a database you do know, e.g. D0021_00_userFlora and you’ll see an overview of the existing databases on that server after connecting.) The driver version depends on your computer and can be looked up using odbc::odbcListDrivers().\nUse existing MSAccess connection name When you query data from a SQL database that is already accessible using MSAccess, such a database is also accessible from R. For Windows users, the most important element is to know the so-called DSN (i.e. a registered Data Source Name). Actually, it is just the name of the database as it is known by your computer (and MS Access). The easiest way to check the DSN is to check the registered ODBC connections in the administrator tools menu.\nFor Dutch-speaking Windows 7 users:\n\u0026gt; Kies in het Configuratiescherm van Windows de optie Systeembeheer \u0026gt; Gegevensbronnen (ODBC). De optie Systeembeheer verschijnt in de categorie Systeem en onderhoud.  You should see a list similar to the list underneath, with the names of the available DSN names enlisted:\nAn alternative way to check the DSN name of a database already working on with Access, is to check the DSN inside MS Access (in dutch, check menu item Koppelingsbeheer):\nFor example, the DSN name UserFlora or Cydonia-prd can be used to query these databases and extract data from it with similar queries to the one used in MSAccess. First of all, the connection with the database need to be established, by using the odbcConnect function, providing the DSN name as argument:\nFor Windows users:\nmy_connection \u0026lt;- odbcConnect(\u0026#34;UserFlora\u0026#34;) Once the connection is successfully established, the database can be queried.\nGet a complete table from the database The function dbReadTable can be used to load an entire table from a database. For example, to extract the tblTaxon table from the flora database:\nrel_taxa \u0026lt;- dbReadTable(my_connection, \u0026#34;relTaxonTaxonGroep\u0026#34;) head(rel_taxa) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()    ID TaxonGroepID TaxonID     1 4 1   2 4 2   3 4 3   4 4 4   5 4 5   6 4 6    The connection my_connection, made earlier, is used as the first argument. The table name is the second argument.\nRemark: If you have no idea about the size of the table you’re trying to load from the database, this could be rather tricky and cumbersome. Hence, it is probably better to only extract a portion of the table using a query.\nExecute a query to the database The function dbGetQuery provides more flexibilty as it can be used to try any SQL-query on the database. A complete introduction to the SQL language is out of scope here. We will focus on the application and the reusage of a query.\nmeting \u0026lt;- dbGetQuery(my_connection, paste(\u0026#34;SELECT TOP 10 * FROM dbo.tblMeting\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WHERE COR_X IS NOT NULL\u0026#34;)) head(meting) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()    ID WaarnemingID TaxonID MetingStatusCode Cor_X Cor_Y CommentaarTaxon CommentaarHabitat CREATION_DATE CREATION_USER UPDATE_DATE UPDATE_USER     2 21748 3909 GDGA 109948 185379 NA NA NA NA NA NA   14 45523 3909 GDGA 127708 179454 NA NA NA NA NA NA   15 124394 3909 GDGA 109424 192152 NA NA NA NA NA NA   23 38561 3909 GDGA 128290 179297 NA NA NA NA NA NA   24 126500 3909 GDGA 98714 178373 NA NA NA NA NA NA   173 73725 3909 GDGA 102612 189891 NA NA NA NA NA NA    Create and use query templates When you regularly use similar queries, with some minimal alterations, you do not want to copy/paste each time the entire query. It is prone to errors and you’re script will become verbose. It is advisable to create query templates, that can be used within the dbGetQuery function.\nConsider the execution of the following query. We are interested in those records with valid X and Y coordinates for the measurement, based on a given dutch name:\nsubset_meting \u0026lt;- dbGetQuery(my_connection, \u0026#34;SELECT meet.COR_X , meet.Cor_Y , meet.MetingStatusCode , tax.NaamNederlands , tax.NaamWetenschappelijk , waar.IFBLHokID FROM tblMeting AS meet LEFT JOIN tblTaxon AS tax ON tax.ID = meet.TaxonID LEFT JOIN tblWaarneming AS waar ON waar.ID = meet.WaarnemingID WHERE meet.Cor_X IS NOT NULL AND meet.Cor_X != 0 AND tax.NaamNederlands LIKE \u0026#39;Wilde hyacint\u0026#39;\u0026#34;) head(subset_meting) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()    COR_X Cor_Y MetingStatusCode NaamNederlands NaamWetenschappelijk IFBLHokID     88720 208327 GDGA Wilde hyacint Hyacinthoides non-scripta (L.)

Chouard ex Rothm. 4830    If we need this query regularly, but each time using a different tax.NaamNederlands (only the name changes), it is worthwhile to invest some time in the creation of a small custom function that uses this query as a template. Let’s create a function flora_records_on_dutch_name that takes a valid database connection and a given Dutch name and returns the relevant subset of the data for this query:\nflora_records_on_dutch_name \u0026lt;- function(dbase_connection, dutch_name) { dbGetQuery(dbase_connection, glue_sql( \u0026#34;SELECT meet.Cor_X , meet.COr_Y , meet.MetingStatusCode , tax.NaamNederlands , tax.NaamWetenschappelijk , waar.IFBLHokID FROM dbo.tblMeting meet LEFT JOIN dbo.tblTaxon AS tax ON tax.ID = meet.TaxonID LEFT JOIN dbo.tblWaarneming AS waar ON waar.ID = meet.WaarnemingID WHERE meet.Cor_X IS NOT NULL AND meet.Cor_X != 0 AND tax.NaamNederlands LIKE {dutch_name}\u0026#34;, dutch_name = dutch_name, .con = dbase_connection)) } Hence, instead of copy-pasting the whole query each time (which could be error-prone), we can reuse the function for different names:\nhyacint \u0026lt;- flora_records_on_dutch_name(my_connection, \u0026#34;Wilde hyacint\u0026#34;) head(hyacint) %\u0026gt;% knitr::kable()    Cor_X COr_Y MetingStatusCode NaamNederlands NaamWetenschappelijk IFBLHokID     88720 208327 GDGA Wilde hyacint Hyacinthoides non-scripta (L.)

The glue_sql function (and the more general glue function) provides the ability to combine text and variable values in a single charactor string (i.e. the query to execute). For each variable name required in the query (any part of your query you want to have interchangeable), a representation in the query is given by the variable name you use in R, put in between curly brackets. For example, if you have the dutch_name variable in R, you can use it inside the query as {dutch_name}:\ndutch_name \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;Jan\u0026#39; an_integer \u0026lt;- 3 a_float \u0026lt;- 2.8 glue(\u0026#39;This prints a combination of a name: {dutch_name}, an integer: {an_integer} and a float value: {a_float}\u0026#39;) ## This prints a combination of a name: Jan, an integer: 3 and a float value: 2.8  Whereas the glue function is a general function for strings, the glue_sql function is specifically created to setup queries to databases.
