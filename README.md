Here you can find the source files for the instructions on the use, installation, and development of research software at the Research Institute of Nature and Forest (INBO). Visit <https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/>  to see the rendered version.

The technology used to create the website is the [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) static website generator. For the coding tutorials, the power of Rmarkdown and [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) features is used. 

New tutorials should go in an new subfolder of `content/tutorials`. Use plain markdown files (`.md`) as much a possible. Use Rmarkdown files (`.Rmd`) when calculations in R are required. For more information about creating a new tutorial, check the [create tutorial](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/create_tutorial/) page.
