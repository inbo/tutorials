      <description>What do the software &amp;ldquo;giants&amp;rdquo; Cisco, Ivanti, and Atlassian all have in common? They all (repeatedly) raised negative attention in the past by pushing hardcoded, unencrypted credentials to the public.

With this tutorial, I would like to document the condensed essence of my own trials and misunderstandings with practical variogram-based analysis.</description>
