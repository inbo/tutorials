      <title>Using WFS service in R</title>

      <description>What is WFS? In computing, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS) Interface Standard provides an interface allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls. One can think of geographical features as the “source code” behind a map, whereas the Web Mapping Service (WMS) interface or online tiled mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze.
The standard output format for reading or downloading data from a WFS is the XML-based Geography Markup Language (GML), but other formats like shapefiles or geojson are also available.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will explain how you can match a list of scientific names against the GBIF backbone taxonomy.
It is important that you have the most recent version of inborutils installed and available:
remotes::install_github(&amp;#34;inbo/inborutils&amp;#34;) # install inborutils library(tidyverse) # To do datascience library(rgbif) # To lookup names in the GBIF backbone taxonomy library(inborutils) # To wrap GBIF API data library(knitr) Read data file containing the scientific names Read file containing the scientific names you want to check against the GBIF taxonomic backbone:</description>

      <title>Using WMS service in R</title>
      <link>https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_wms_services/</link>

      <description>WMS stands for Web Map Service. The service provides prerendered tiles at different scales. This makes it useful to include them as background images in maps.
wms_grb links to the WMS of the GRB-basiskaart, the Flemish cadastral map. It depicts land parcels, buildings, watercourses, roads and railroads.
wms_ortho contains a mosaic of recent orthophotos made during the winter. The layer Ortho contains the images, the layer Vliegdagcontour detail on the time when the pictures were taken.</description>
