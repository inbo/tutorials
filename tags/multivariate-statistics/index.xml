      <description>During the course of the years, we have taught many statistics courses at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), both for scientists and technicians. Most of these courses have been developed and taught in-house. Some (mostly advanced) courses were taught in-house by external teachers.
While we do plan to periodically repeat these courses for new employees and as a refresher, the course material can always be consulted and used for self-teaching or as a reference.</description>
