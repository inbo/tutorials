      <description>Introduction  Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.
 (First Law according to Waldo Tobler)
This remarkably unquantitative statement, or &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;, is described on wikipedia as &amp;ldquo;a direct product of the quantitative revolution&amp;rdquo; in Geography. Contrast it with the wikipedia article on variograms, which is full of jargon and seemingly complicated equations.
With this tutorial, I would like to document the condensed essence of my own trials and misunderstandings with practical variogram-based analysis.</description>

      <description>What you will learn In this tutorial we explain the analogy between the paired t-test and the corresponding mixed model formulation.

Let’s look at a simple timeseries with multiple observations per timepoint.

      <description>This document is a quick and dirty illustration of how spatially correlated random effect can be fit with INLA. It is based on the question and the data posted on the R-Sig-mixedmodels mailing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mixed-models/2016q3/024938.html.

      <title>INLA workshops</title>

      <description>These workshops are a follow-up of the course on &amp;ldquo;Spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal models using R-INLA&amp;rdquo; by Alain Zuur and Elena Ieno (Highland Statistics Ltd.). The main goal is the get people using R-INLA with their own data in a workshop setting so they can tap into the knowledge of others. The workshops are not a copy of the Highstat course but elaborate certain topics. We also introduce the inlatools and inlabru.</description>
