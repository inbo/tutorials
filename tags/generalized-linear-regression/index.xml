      <description>In the fall of 2023, a tutorial on Bayesian statistics with the brms packages was organised at INBO. Before you start the tutorial, please follow the instructions in this R script to install brms properly. For more advanced use cases, we added an example of how to directly use stan via the rstan package. All course material can be found in Dutch and English on the following pages:
 The English tutorial with all course material to test the examples yourself.</description>

      <title>Statistics courses @ INBO!</title>

      <description>During the course of the years, we have taught many statistics courses at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), both for scientists and technicians. Most of these courses have been developed and taught in-house. Some (mostly advanced) courses were taught in-house by external teachers.
While we do plan to periodically repeat these courses for new employees and as a refresher, the course material can always be consulted and used for self-teaching or as a reference.</description>
