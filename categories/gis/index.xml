      <title>The UTM grid and the MGRS grid: not quite the same</title>
      <link>http://tutorials.inbo.be/articles/spatial_mgrs/</link>

      <description>Summary Grids are widely used in biodiversity monitoring to define the basic spatial units for data collection, data processing or mapping. In this post I explain differences between the UTM and MGRS grids, provide references to their full definition and refer to some software implementations for MGRS.
Main points:
 The UTM grid and the MGRS grid outside the polar regions are both derived from the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) map projection system.</description>

      <title>Using WMS services in R</title>
      <link>http://tutorials.inbo.be/tutorials/spatial_wms_services/</link>

      <description>WMS stands for Web Map Service. The service provides prerendered tiles at different scales. This makes it useful to include them as background images in maps.
We will use the leaflet package to make interactive maps.
library(leaflet) First, we define some WMS URLs for Flanders and Belgium to play with:
# Flanders: wms_grb &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;https://geo.api.vlaanderen.be/GRB-basiskaart/wms&amp;#34; wms_ortho &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;https://geo.api.vlaanderen.be/OMWRGBMRVL/wms&amp;#34; wms_inbo &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;https://geo.api.vlaanderen.be/INBO/wms&amp;#34; wms_hunting &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;https://geo.api.vlaanderen.be/Jacht/wms&amp;#34; # Belgium: wms_cartoweb_be &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;https://cartoweb.wms.ngi.be/service&amp;#34; wms_ortho_be &amp;lt;- &amp;#34;https://wms.</description>

      <title>Coordinate operations and maps in R</title>

      <description>Introduction and setup This tutorial originated while preparing an R-demonstration during a GIS club at INBO on 16 September 2021. (Further material of the GIS club is available here.)
A straightforward approach for transforming spatial data is available in another tutorial. The current tutorial tackles a few extra aspects.
The tutorial assumes you have some pre-existing knowledge:
 Basic knowledge about coordinate reference systems (CRSs) and geodetic datums; see another tutorial and the references and links therein.</description>

      <title>Goodbye PROJ.4! How to specify a coordinate reference system in R?</title>

      <description>Coordinate reference systems: minimal background What? A coordinate reference system (CRS) – also called spatial reference system (SRS) – is what you need if you want to interpret numeric coordinates as actual point locations with reference to the Earth. Two types of coordinate reference system are much used in spatial science: geodetic and projected CRSs. The former serve only to locate coordinates relative to a 3D model of the Earth surface, while the latter add a projection to generate coordinates on a 2D map.</description>

      <title>How to use open raster file formats in R: GeoTIFF &amp; GeoPackage</title>
      <link>http://tutorials.inbo.be/tutorials/spatial_standards_raster/</link>

      <description>During the current transition period of supporting both old and new PROJ/GDAL, you may get a decent portion of proj4string-related warnings when running the below code, but you can safely ignore them. For more information, see the CRS tutorial.
This tutorial uses a few basic functions from the dplyr and raster packages. While only a few functions are used, you can use the previous hyperlinks to access the tutorials (vignettes) of these packages for more functions and information.</description>

      <title>How to use open vector file formats in R: GeoPackage &amp; GeoJSON</title>

      <description>This tutorial uses a few basic functions from the dplyr and sf packages. While only a few functions are used, you can use the previous hyperlinks to access the tutorials (vignettes) of these packages for more functions and information.
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) library(tidyverse) library(sf) library(inborutils) You will find a bit more background about ‘why and what’, regarding the considered open standards, in a separate post on this website.
In short, the GeoPackage and GeoJSON formats are ideal for exchange, publication, interoperability &amp;amp; durability and to open science in general.</description>

      <title>Meet some popular open geospatial standards!</title>
      <link>http://tutorials.inbo.be/articles/geospatial_standards/</link>

      <description>Some inspiration for this post came from the beautiful books of Lovelace et al. (2020), Pebesma &amp;amp; Bivand (2019) and Hijmans (2019), and from various websites.
Why use open standards?  Open file standards ease collaboration, portability and compatibility between users, machines and applications. Their (file) structure is fully documented.  Consequently, scientists and programmers can build new software / packages and make innovations that use these standards, while maintaining interoperability with existing applications.</description>

      <title>How to make spatial joins (point in polygon)?</title>
      <link>http://tutorials.inbo.be/tutorials/spatial_point_in_polygon/</link>

      <description>library(R.utils) library(rgdal) library(tidyverse) library(leaflet) library(sp) library(sf) library(rgbif) library(DBI) What we want to do In this short tutorial, we explore various options to deal with the situation where we have (1) a spatially referenced GIS file with polygons and (2) a spatially referenced set of points that overlaps with the GIS polygons.
Typically, both data sources contain information (apart from the spatial locations) that needs to be related to each other in some way.</description>
