      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Variograms</title>

      <description>Introduction  Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.
 (First Law according to Waldo Tobler)
This remarkably unquantitative statement, or &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;, is described on wikipedia as &amp;ldquo;a direct product of the quantitative revolution&amp;rdquo; in Geography. Contrast it with the wikipedia article on variograms, which is full of jargon and seemingly complicated equations.
With this tutorial, I would like to document the condensed essence of my own trials and misunderstandings with practical variogram-based analysis.</description>

      <title>Tutorial Bayesian statistics with brms</title>

      <description>In the fall of 2023, a tutorial on Bayesian statistics with the brms packages was organised at INBO. Before you start the tutorial, please follow the instructions in this R script to install brms properly. For more advanced use cases, we added an example of how to directly use stan via the rstan package. All course material can be found in Dutch and English on the following pages:
 The English tutorial with all course material to test the examples yourself.</description>

      <description>At the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), we are eager to sustain, promote and develop open-source software that is relevant to biodiversity researchers! This page lists R and Python packages which INBO developed or made a significant contribution to. Several of these packages continue being developed.
Please, feel free to try out packages! If you encounter a problem or if you have a suggestion, we encourage you to post an issue on the package’s code repository.</description>

      <description>During the course of the years, we have taught many statistics courses at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), both for scientists and technicians. Most of these courses have been developed and taught in-house. Some (mostly advanced) courses were taught in-house by external teachers.
While we do plan to periodically repeat these courses for new employees and as a refresher, the course material can always be consulted and used for self-teaching or as a reference.</description>

      <description>This document is a quick and dirty illustration of how spatially correlated random effect can be fit with INLA. It is based on the question and the data posted on the R-Sig-mixedmodels mailing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mixed-models/2016q3/024938.html.

      <description>These workshops are a follow-up of the course on &amp;ldquo;Spatial, temporal and spatial-temporal models using R-INLA&amp;rdquo; by Alain Zuur and Elena Ieno (Highland Statistics Ltd.). The main goal is the get people using R-INLA with their own data in a workshop setting so they can tap into the knowledge of others. The workshops are not a copy of the Highstat course but elaborate certain topics. We also introduce the inlatools and inlabru.</description>
