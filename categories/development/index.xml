      <description>What do the software &amp;ldquo;giants&amp;rdquo; Cisco, Ivanti, and Atlassian all have in common? They all (repeatedly) raised negative attention in the past by pushing hardcoded, unencrypted credentials to the public.
This brief tutorial will help you to not be the poor intern who is rightfully expelled for such a fatal beginners&#39; mistake.
The programming environment we will use is R. The package of choice is keyring, but it will be spiced up with some extra precautions.</description>

      <title>An Algorithmic Approach to Variograms</title>

      <description>Introduction  Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.
 (First Law according to Waldo Tobler)
This remarkably unquantitative statement, or &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo;, is described on wikipedia as &amp;ldquo;a direct product of the quantitative revolution&amp;rdquo; in Geography. Contrast it with the wikipedia article on variograms, which is full of jargon and seemingly complicated equations.
With this tutorial, I would like to document the condensed essence of my own trials and misunderstandings with practical variogram-based analysis.</description>

      <description>At the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), we are eager to sustain, promote and develop open-source software that is relevant to biodiversity researchers! This page lists R and Python packages which INBO developed or made a significant contribution to. Several of these packages continue being developed.
Please, feel free to try out packages! If you encounter a problem or if you have a suggestion, we encourage you to post an issue on the package’s code repository.</description>

      <description>Set up continuous integration with Wercker There are 2 major steps to set up continuous integration:
 create a wercker.yml file in the package add the application (package) to Wercker.com  To be able to add a package to Wercker, one must have administrator rights on the package repository on Github.
The Wercker test environment can only be set up if the file wercker.yml is commited to the repository, but Wercker is triggered to start checking when the application is added to wercker.</description>

      <description>R CMD check has a large set of generic quality tests on a package. It is impossible to create generic tests that check the content of the package. E.g. does each function return sensible results. However, R CMD check does run a set unit tests. These are small pieces of code written by the package developer which test the output of a specific function under specific circumstances. We highly recommend the testthat framework for writing unit tests.</description>
