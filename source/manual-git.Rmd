## Make a commit: command line

1. Check the differences: `git status` and `git diff`
2. Commit your changes: `git commit`

---

## Push your changes to backup your work

* GitHub Desktop: click `Sync`
* Command line: `git push origin master`

---

## Go to your repo on GitHub to verify

![Verify your commits on GitHub](manual-git/local-commit-on-github.png)

---

## Create logical commits

1. Make 2 unrelated changes to your `README.md` locally
2. Create one commit for each change.
3. Do not push (yet)

---

## Create logical commits: GitHub Desktop

![Logical commit 2](manual-git/logical-commit-2.png)

---

## Create logical commits: command line

`git add -p README.md`

## Create a conflict

Update your `README.md` on GitHub, on a line you also edited locally

![Commit to create conflict](manual-git/commit-to-create-conflict.png)

---

## Conflict: GitHub Desktop

Try to push your local changes

![Conflict](manual-git/conflict.png)

---

## Conflict: command line

```
git pull origin master
```

## Keep calm and resolve conflict

1. Open `README.md` in text editor:

        <<<<<<< HEAD
        A simple analysis to visualize my favourite fruit colour.
        =======
        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit color.
        >>>>>>> origin/master

2. Choose what you want to keep:

        A simple analysis to discover my favourite fruit colour.

3. Commit and push

---

## Add file

1. Add a `data.csv` for the data
2. Remove this content from the `README.md`

## Add a file: GitHub Desktop

...

---

## Add a file: command line

1. `git add data.csv`
2. `git commit -am "Add data file" data.csv`
3. `git push origin master`

---

## Undo or adapt last commit: GitHub Desktop

...

---

## Undo or adapt last commit: command line

1. `git revert HEAD`

**Remark:** `git revert` can be applied to any commit, more in depth information about undoing of commits is given in LINK TO MD TODO

---

## View history: GitHub Desktop

...

---

## View history: command line

1. `git log`
2. Copy a HASH
3. `git checkout HASH`
4. Check the local directory and files on your computer
5. `git checkout master`

**Linux user Tip:** Add an alias to your `.bash_aliases`:

```
alias glog="git log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(bold)%h%Creset%C(magenta)%d%Creset %s %C(yellow)<%an> %C(cyan)(%cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
```

---



---
## Experiment with changes

* Create a branch (`git checkout -b myfeaturebranch`)
* Get an overview of your branches `git branch`
* `git add` a file to the repository
* Go back to the status of the master (`git checkout master`)
* Verify your local folder structure (where is the file?)
* Go back to the status of the new branch (`git checkout myfeaturebranch`)

---
Merge branches
* Go back to the status of the master (`git checkout master`)
* `git merge myfeaturebranch` to the master branch 
* Verify your local folder structure (where is the file?)
* Delete the `myfeaturebranch` (`git branch -d myfeaturebranch`)

---

## Exclude files

Passwords and large files need to be excluded from the version control!

* Go to master branch `git checkout master`
* Create a new file `password.txt` with the words `SECRET`
* `git status` and `git diff`
* Adapt `.gitignore` to exclude the `password.txt` file
* `git status` and `git diff`
* `git commit` your adaptation to the `.gitignore` file
* `git push` your changes to GitHub
* Verify the `.gitignore` file on GitHub

# Working together

## Teaming up
* Team up with two or three persons
* Let one person invite the others, provide them with read/write access as explained in [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)

## Online collaboration
* All raise an issue online
* provide these issues with an appropriate label

---
* Make an adaptation to an online file
* Propose a `pull request` and assign your collaborator
* Merge the adaptation to the `master` branch

## Working local - merging online

* As collaborator, `git clone` the other repository to your local computer
* Create each a new branch with a different name (`git checkout -b mybranchname`)
* Adapt the content of a file
* `git commit` your adaptation
* `git push origin mybranchname` to the remote location
* Go to GitHub and make a `pull request`
* Revise eachother work and **mege online** when appropriate

---
Update your local work
* Locally, go to master branch `git checkout master`
* Get the remote work `git fetch origin`
* Update your local master `git merge --ff-only origin/master`
* Check if all adaptations are represented in your local files

---

## Release

We are satisfied about outcome analysis. A release can be useful...
* ...for publications (DOI)
* ...for code/software development
* ...for course notes

[This tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) explains how to create a release.
