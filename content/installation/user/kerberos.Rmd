## Introduction

*(shamelessly taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)))*

Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. 

Windows 2000 and later uses Kerberos as its default authentication method. Many UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems, including [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD), Apple's [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X), [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux), [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_microsystems)'s [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)), IBM's [AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIX) and [Z/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS), HP's [HP-UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX) and [OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) and others, include software for Kerberos authentication of users or services. 

Hence, we can use the protocol to have an OS independent solution for authentication across different databases. In this document, the installation and configuration for **linux/mac users** is provided as well as an introduction to the usage of the authentication service to connect to databases. For windows users (in the domain) the authentication is provided by default.

## Installation

### Libraries for authentication

For debian/ubuntu users (make sure you belong to the `sudo` group):

```
sudo apt-get install krb5-user libpam-krb5 libpam-ccreds auth-client-config
sudo apt-get install openssl
```

These libraries will be used later on. The following section is for interaction with MS SQL databases.

### MS SQL Server tools

As most of the databases at INBO are SQL Server, an appropriate driver and the command line toolset is required  to fully support database connections to SQL Server.

#### ODBC driver

Download and install the [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53339).   The installation instructions for different Linux flavours can be downloaded together with the ODBC driver. For `Ubuntu 16.04` (and most distributions based on it),  following instructions apply:

```
sudo su
apt-get install curl
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssqlrelease.list
exit
sudo apt-get update
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install msodbcsql=13.1.4.0-1
sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
```

#### mssql-tools

Install the MS SQL tools as well:

* **sqlcmd**: Command-line query utility.
* **bcp**: Bulk import-export utility.

The instructions for different platforms are explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools). In order to test the SQL connection later in this tutorial, add `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/` to your PATH environment variable.

You could also decide to go for the binaries: download [the debian package of mssql-tools](https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/mssql-ubuntu-xenial-release/pool/main/m/mssql-tools/mssql-tools_14.0.1.246-1_amd64.deb) and install with:

```
sudo apt-get install libgss3
sudo dpkg -i mssql-tools_14.0.1.246-1_amd64.deb
```

### Configure Kerberos client

*(again, the commands assume root privileges)*

Start with the kerberos configuration dialogue:

```
dpkg-reconfigure krb5-config
```
Use `INBO.BE` as the realm (this is the realm of the kerberos servers):
![](./images/kerberos_config_1.png)

Make sure to use DNS to find these servers, so choose 'NO' if you get the below question:
![](./images/kerberos_config_2.png)

Next, adapt the `krb5.conf`, probably available in the `/etc` directory.  Add the following sections with configurations to the file:

```
[realms]
        INBO.BE = {
                kdc = inbo-ad-aws-01-prd.inbo.be
                kdc = inbo-ad-aws-02-prd.inbo.be
                kdc = inbogerdc.inbo.be
                kdc = inbogrodc01.inbo.be
                kdc = inbolindc01.inbo.be
                default_domain = inbo.be
        }

[logging]
	default = FILE:/var/log/krblibs.log
	kdc = FILE:/var/log/krbkdc.log
	admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmind.log

[libdefaults]
	default_realm = INBO.BE
	dns_lookup_realm = false
	dns_lookup_kdc = false
	ticket_lifetime = 24h
	renew_lifetime = 7d
	forwardable=  true
```

In order to sync the timing of the domain controller server and client side, install `ntp`:

```
sudo apt-get install ntp
```
After installation, check if the following two files do exist: 
* `/etc/ntp.conf`
* `/etc/ntp.conf.dhcp` (empty file, just amke sure there is a file)

### Test installations

#### kerberos ticket system

To check if the Kerberos configuration is successful, ask for a ticket by initiating with `kinit`:
```
kinit your_user_name
```

If no errors are prodused, check the existing tickets with `klist`:
```
klist
```
This should produce a list of successfully granted tickets, so something similar as:

```
Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
03/01/18 15:42:08  04/01/18 01:42:08  krbtgt/INBO.BE@INBO.BE
	renew until 10/01/18 15:42:08
```

#### SQL database connections

When the ticketing is working, the next step is to use the authentication to connect to the databases itself. To test this, we'll use the `sqlcmd` command line tool. In a next section, we'll focus on the ODBC settings.

Testing with `sqlcmd` (make sure you have an active ticket):

```
sqlcmd -S inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be -E
1> Select top 10 name from sys.databases;
2> Go
```

Type `quit` to exit.

### SQL ODBC connections

To support  database connections from other applications (e.g. GUI environments, but also R, Python,...), the configuration of database drivers and connections should be provided in the `/etc/odbc.ini` and `/etc/odbcinst.ini`.

Make sure the ODBC driver for SQL Server is available with a recognizable name in the `/etc/odbcinst.ini` file:
```
[ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server]
Description=Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server
Driver=/opt/microsoft/msodbcsql/lib64/libmsodbcsql-13.1.so.4.0
UsageCount=2
```
<<<<<<< HEAD:content/installation/user/kerberos.md

To get a list of all databases on a server (make sure you have an active ticket):

```
sqlcmd -S inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be -E
1> Select name from sys.databases;
2> Go
```

#### Connecting by explicitly providing the SQL connection string to ODBC libraries/packages

At this moment, you can actually connect using typical ODBC libraries/packages provided by R or Python:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(DBI)
connection <- dbConnect(
  odbc::odbc(), 
  .connection_string = "Driver={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};Server=inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be;Database=D0017_00_NBNData;Trusted_Connection=yes;"
)
dbListTables(connection)
```

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import pyodbc
conn = pyodbc.connect("Driver={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};Server=inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be;Database=D0017_00_NBNData;Trusted_Connection=yes;")
```

In RStudio, you can also make the connection with the GUI:

- Go to the _Connections_ pane and click 'New Connection'.
- In the window that opens, choose the _ODBC Driver for SQL Server_.
- In the _Parameters_ field that comes next, add `Server=inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be;Database=D0017_00_NBNData;Trusted_Connection=yes;`.
    - Note that the `DBI` connection statement is visible at the bottom field of the dialog window.
- Click _Test_ to verify successful connection.
    - If connection is unsuccessful, try again after explicitly adding your username to the connection string: `User ID=your_username;`
- If the test is successful, click _OK_ to make the connection.

Beside the fact that the connection has been made (see RStudio's R console), you also get a list of all databases (of the specific SQL Server) in the Connections pane. You can use this for exploratory purposes. Click [here](https://db.rstudio.com/rstudio/connections/) for more information on using RStudio's Connections pane.


#### UNTESTED: Connecting after configuring `odbc.ini`

However, it is probably easier to provide the configuration to specific databases directly, using the `/etc/odbc.ini` file. For example, the `NBNData_IPT` database can be defined as follows:

```
[nbn_ipt]
Driver      = ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server
Description = INBOSQL07\PRD
Trace       = No
Server      = inbo-sql07-prd.inbo.be
Database    = D0017_00_NBNData
Port        = 1433
```

Next, add the 

inbosql04.inbo.be


**TODO:**
-> example in R/Python
-> also available in Rstudio!
