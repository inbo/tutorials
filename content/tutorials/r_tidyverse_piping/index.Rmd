# How to use piping in R

Normally, you would do this:
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

However, with piping, this would look different:
```{r}
mtcars %>% head()
```

### You may wonder, what's the point?

If you need to apply multiple functions on one dataframe, piping saves you a lot of typing, and makes for tidy R code. An example:
```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(dec = mpg/10) %>%
  select(mpg, dec, am) %>%
  filter(am == "1")
```

What did we do:  
 1. We created a new column 'dec' using `mutate()`. This column 'dec' consists of the values of column mpg divided by 10.  
 2. We selected the columns 'mpg', 'dec' and 'am' using `select()`.  
 3. We filtered for the value '1' in the column 'am' using `filter()`.  
 
#### And all of this in **just one step**!

## Now what?

We have created a new column, but this column is not part of our dataframe yet!  
We could do this:
```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(dec = mpg/10)
```

**OR**... we could do this!
```{r}
library(magrittr)

mtcars %<>% 
  mutate(dec = mpg/10)
```

### Soooo easy!  

This has been our first introduction to piping. There is however much more to learn!
