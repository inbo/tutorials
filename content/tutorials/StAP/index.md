# Overview

Statistical Analysis Plans (StAPs) were introduced at INBO in october 2025.
This page gathers all information you need to write your own StAP.
For now, we provide the slides for the lessons that have been given and the latest template to download.
In the future, we will add recordings of the classes and a step-by-step procedure to start, make, and review your StAP

# Lessons

## Module 1
[Slides lesson 1](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/stap/StAP-module1-part1.pdf)

# Template
For now we only provide a .gdoc template which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DMmAxMF_kkYFW4tSR2fVhX0Bx7FkP0we6Mo33LzRXIk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7kmxpvcq7ddn).
In the future, we plan to provide a Dutch version of the template and a RMarkDown template as well.


# Procedure
Once the process is streamlined, we will describe the procedure to start, make, and review your StAP here.
