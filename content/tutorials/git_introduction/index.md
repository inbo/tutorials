At INBO, people do write code and require version control. As git is not the most straightforward environment to 
work with for non-IT specialists, we try to define our own sub-ecosystem with relevant practices and an 
achievable workflow.

To introduce the concept of version control with Git and Github, a separate git course website is 
available [here](https://inbo.github.io/git-course/index.html). 

The git course provides an introduction on main terminology of Git based on 5 important tasks:

1. Tell the story of your project
2. Travel back in time
3. Experiment with changes
4. Backup your work
5. Collaborate on projects

Next, a hands-on session to use [git with Rstudio](https://inbo.github.io/git-course/course_rstudio.html) is 
part of the course. It can also be used as a reference to the indidivual steps when using git. When looking 
for a step-wise workflow to use git(hub) with Rstudio, check the 
[Rstudio workflow](https://inbo.github.io/git-course/workflow_rstudio.html).
