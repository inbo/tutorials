# The INBO citation style

Most journals, publishers and companies use a specified format for citations and bibliographies.
The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) is no exception.

All bibliography managers provide ways to automate the formatting of citations and bibliographies which greatly facilitates scientific publishing.
Depending on the bibliographic manager software, the style formatting rules are stored in specific files.
In this tutorial you will learn how to use the INBO citation style in EndNote, Mendeley and Zotero bibliography managers.

EndNote uses a `*.ens` file to store the style formatting rules, whereas Mendeley and Zotero use the open standard `*.csl` [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/).
EndNote, Zotero and Mendeley have recommended ways of finding and installing these files and will always point to the latest version of the style files when properly installed.
This is explained in [Use in bibliography managers].

The latest official CSL file of the INBO citation style is available at the CSL style repository (also transferred automatically to the Zotero style repository) and can be found [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/research-institute-for-nature-and-forest.csl).
In case older versions are needed, they can be obtained from successively numbered releases from our [forked styles repo](https://github.com/inbo/styles/releases).
To use older versions, you will need to manually download and add the file to your reference manager.

The EndNote `*.ens` file can be downloaded [here](https://sites.google.com/a/inbo.be/intranet/ondersteuning/bibliotheek/endnote-informatie/endnotehuisstijl) (only accessible for INBO employees).

Guidelines on how to use Mendeley in combination with MS Word or LibreOffice can be found [here](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/using-citation-editor).

## EndNote
