In the fall of 2023, a tutorial on Bayesian statistics with the [**brms**](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) packages was organised at INBO.
Before you start the tutorial, please follow the instructions in [this R script](https://github.com/inbo/tutorials/blob/master/content/tutorials/r_brms/brms_eng/install_packages.R) to install brms properly.
All course material can be found in Dutch and English on the following pages:

- The [English tutorial](../../html/workshop_1_mcmc_en_brms_eng.html) with all [course material](https://github.com/inbo/tutorials/tree/master/content/tutorials/r_brms/brms_eng) to test the examples yourself.
- The [Dutch tutorial](../../html/workshop_1_mcmc_en_brms.html) with all [course material](https://github.com/inbo/tutorials/tree/master/content/tutorials/r_brms/brms_nl) to test the examples yourself.
