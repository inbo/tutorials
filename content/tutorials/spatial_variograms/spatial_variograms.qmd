# Introduction

> Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.

[*(First Law according to Waldo Tobler)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography)


This remarkably unquantitative statement, or "law", is described [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography#Background) as "a direct product of the quantitative revolution" in Geography.
Contrast it with the [wikipedia article on variograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram), which is full of jargon and seemingly complicated equations.

With this tutorial, I would like to document the condensed essence of my own trials and misunderstandings with practical variogram-based analysis.
We will see below that variograms are not that complicated after all.


The latter wikipedia article is a reminder that wikipedia generally is a non-academic, low quality resource.
For example:

- They [initially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#) describe a (semi-)variogram as **"a [mathematical] function"**.
- That "function" describes the "degree of dependence" of a spatial random field (pro tip: if it is dependent, it is not random, such as the distribution of gold ore used as an introductory example is not random).
- As becomes unclear [afterwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Definition), that function is not "variance" (`var()`), but something else. Although the whole thing is called *variogram*, variance is in fact the "degree of dependence".
- Then, they distinguish an **empirical variogram** ([here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Empirical_variogram)). I would <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(Philosophie)">refer to</a> the popular philosopher Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov on this: "Praxis is the criterion of truth"[^1], i.e. there exists no useful *non-empirical variogram*.
- Finally, ["variogram models"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Variogram_models) are mentioned, which are actually *the function* we began with. They are not just *one* function: there are many options, with the unmentioned Matérn being the generalization for a Gaussian- to Exponential class of functions.


[^1]: As a fun fact, reference to Lenin is prominently present in the German wikipedia, but not in the English one.


My personal definition of the term **variogram** would rather describe it as a moderately flexible algorithm. 
This notion is based on the actual implementation and application of the technique in various computer software libraries (R: `gstat::variogram`, `geoR::variog`, `fields::vgram`; Python: `skgstat.Variogram`), as well as primary references given below.

::: {.callout-warning}
The common steps of performing variogram-based data analysis are:

1. **parameter choice**, find or define the measure one would like to compare between locations within a well-organized data set
2. **cross-calculate** distance and difference of measurement locations 
3. **binning** by distance (and optionally direction), thereby calculating semivariance or any other aggregated **measure of difference** per bin
4. **modeling**, i.e. performing a regression (Matérn, Gauss, ...) on the difference-distance data
5. **kriging** (optional) is the application of the model for spatial interpolation (not shown)

:::


I will implement these steps below, and interested readers are invited to confirm for themselves that the outcome matches the abundant variogram implementations in the mentioned libraries.
The focus of this notebook is *the code*, interspersed with rather brief hints and explanations.
The reason I present this is, first of all, *educational* (take-home ideas summarized in the blue boxes). 
Beyond that, I experienced some frustration with reproducibility of some of the variograms common libraries would give me: they simply do not *document all the steps involved*.
Most of the intermediate steps are trivial by themselves, and giving the combined procedure the fancy name "variogram" seems like "hiding traces" to me.
Mastering the building blocks can empower you to get creative with them.
As a bonus, and to my surprise, the **cross-calculation of distance and difference** seems to be *computationally more efficient* if implemented as below ([@sec-crossdifference]), which **enables the calculation of variograms for far bigger data sets**.
But your mileage may vary, so feel invited to try it yourself.


Enjoy!


```{r setup}
#| eval: true
.libPaths("/data/R/library")
void <- suppressPackageStartupMessages
# library("sp") |> void()

# our beloved tidyverse components:
library("dplyr") |> void() 
library("ggplot2") |> void()  
library("ggridges")  |> void() # density ridges
library("parallel")  |> void() # parallel processing, for bootstrapping

```


# Data

We will work on a simulated data set of more or less random values, in which we know *a priori* what is going on.


## Simulation Settings

Some general settings that define our synthetic data set:

```{r settings}
n_observations <- 2^13 # sample size
extent <- 128 # width of the playing field
smooth_sigma <- 16 # smoothing range for creating spatial inter-dependence via Gaussian convolution ("smoothing")
zrange <- 2*pi # range of parameter values

# covariate effect magnitudes
a_slope <- pi/3
b_slope <- pi/4

```


## Raw Random

Generating a data set of random points for playing around.

```{r simulation}
gimme_points <- function(N = 100, scale = 1.0) (runif(N)*2.0-1.0) * scale
data <- data.frame(
  x = gimme_points(n_observations, extent),
  y = gimme_points(n_observations, extent),
  z_ = gimme_points(n_observations, zrange)
)
knitr::kable(head(data, 5))
```

*Mental note: points towards the rim will tend to have fewer neighbors. Or, in general, mind your spatial layout! (Sparse/dense? Clustered/homogeneous? ...)*


## Common Covariate Classes

I also want to throw in two covariates, say... `a` and `b`.
Those stand in for real covariates.
One of them will systematically and continuously vary with the location (think of a North-South temperature gradient, or gradual humidity based on surface water distance).
The other is completely random, and categorical (e.g. micro-habitat subclasses, like in patches of vegetation on an agricultural landscape).

```{r covariate-definition}

data$a <- 0.7 * data$x / extent + 0.3 * data$y / extent

```

As you see, `a` is continuous, but correlated to `x` and `y`.


In contrast, `b` is a categorical and randomly distributed:

```{r covariate-b}
data$b <- as.integer(rbinom(n = n_observations, size = 1, prob = 0.4))

data$z <- data$z_ + a_slope * data$a + b_slope * data$b

knitr::kable(head(data, 3))
```

There no noise applied to those covariates, moderate noise on the raw data, so they should be recover-able by a statistical model.


Visualizing, with color:

```{r datavis}
#| label: fig-raw-data
#| fig-cap: "The raw data, unsmoothed."

# https://stackoverflow.com/a/9946970
rbpal <- colorRampPalette(c('black','gold'))
color <- rbpal(n_observations)[as.numeric(cut(data$z, breaks = n_observations))]

plot(data$x, data$y, col = color, pch = as.integer(18 + 2*data$b),
  xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
```


If you look closely, the upper right is more golden than the lower left. 
This is the effect of covariate `a`. 
Symbols indicate the categorical covariate `b`.

All rather random.


This artificial dataset is a placeholder for any real data you or someone else might have collected.
All these data sets have in common that there are spatial coordinates involved (here `x` and `y` without loss of generality; you can trivially add a third spatial dimension). 
I mostly skip step 1 (**parameter choice**) from the list above, because it is a rather individual undertaking. 
Ensure that your data is accurate, [exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html), evaluation and feedback with meetings and stakeholders - these sorts of things.
The parameter of interest does not have to be a raw measurement, but can be the end of a long data analysis and modeling pipeline (more on this in [@sec-detrending]).


## Cross-Difference {#sec-crossdifference}

The following one-line functions are a major game-changer for large data sets, in particular the `self_difference()`.
Their purpose is to compute the difference of all elements of one vector to each other, in matrix form.
The `outer` vector product is well-implemented in R, most efficient, which allows this to be applied to long vectors.
There are many applications beyond the one shown here.
Try to read and understand them one by one, and [go beyond](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/outer-function-in-r) the [limited R documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/outer.html).


With `self_difference`, we can define a simple function to calculate the Euclidean cross-distance of points within a data set.
We can even make the distance wrap at the edges, simply using the modulo in `wrap_difference`, but that is specific to our artificial test case and probably has little relevance in real life.
The modified `Euclid_wrap` effectively gives us an infinite playing field.


Those functions return matrices, with all the vector indices in rows and columns. 
Usually, we only require unique cross-combinations of elements in arbitrary order, which can be achieved by `lower_triangl`ing the matrix (grabbing the lower triangle of a matrix with `lower.tri`).


```{r cross-distance}
# compute the difference of all elements of one vector to each other
self_difference <- function (vec) outer(X = vec, Y = vec, FUN = function(X, Y)  Y-X)
wrap_difference <- function (vec) outer(X = vec, Y = vec, FUN = function(X, Y) (Y-X) %% (2*extent))

# Calculate the Euclidean distance of the x and y columns in a data frame.
Euclid <- function (data) sqrt(self_difference(data$x)^2 + self_difference(data$y)^2 )
Euclid_wrap <- function (data) sqrt(wrap_difference(data$x)^2 + wrap_difference(data$y)^2 )

# return the lower triangle of a matrix, unpacking it into a vector of unique values
lower_triangle <- function (mat) mat[lower.tri(mat)]
```

This was just an opportunistic excourse to step 2 **cross calculation** from the roadmap. 
In fact, we are not yet finished preparing our test data set (for which these functions are useful).


## Simple Smoothing {#sec-smoothing}

Just so that we can optionally incorporate **some Tobler spirit**: a smoother.
2D smoothing, or "convolution with a 2D Gaussian", as the pro's call it, is what creates relation among adjacent points.

```{r smoothing}

# smoothing 2D data
smooth <- function (data, sigma = NULL) {
  
  if (sigma <= 0 || is.null(sigma) || is.na(sigma)) {
    return(data$z)
  }

  dist <- Euclid_wrap(data)
  # sigma <- extent / 3
  weight <- dnorm(dist, 0, sigma) 
  weight <- weight / colSums(weight)
  # do.call("cbind", rep(list(data$z), length(data$z)))
  
  zmoothed <- weight %*% data$z
  return (zmoothed[,1])
}
```


Smoothing just smoothes all the points, irrespective of groups in the categorical `b`.
To get something out of the parameter we implemented, better smooth group-wise.

```{r plot-smoothing}
#| label: fig-smooth-data
#| fig-cap: "The data, smoothed with a 2D Gaussian kernel. The edges are darker due to edge wrapping."

groupwise_smoothing <- function (grp) {
  sub_data <- data %>%
    filter(b == grp)
  sub_data$s <- smooth(sub_data, smooth_sigma)
  return(sub_data)
}

# "split-apply-combine" strategy
data <- bind_rows(lapply(sort(unique(data$b)),
  FUN = groupwise_smoothing
  ))
color <- rbpal(n_observations)[as.numeric(cut(data$s, breaks = n_observations))]
plot(data$x, data$y, col = color, pch = 20,
  xlab = "x", ylab = "y")

```

Nice and smooth. 
Feel free to draw a sunset by adjusting `a` and removing the groups.


Note that I chose `s` here as a variable name for the smoothed `z`, which should not be confused with the $s$ often used elsewhere to descripe the position vector of locations.


::: {.callout-note}
We chose Gaussian smoothing here.
Hold that thought.
As will become clear in the end, the **assumption of Gaussian spatial interdependence** is what will allow the Matérn regression to work ([@sec-matern]) in the *modeling* step.
:::


# Variograms {#sec-variograms}

## Debatable "De-Trending" {#sec-detrending}

For good reasons, which I hope to make clear below, variogram functions such as `gstat::variogram()` provide the option of de-trending the data.
This is demonstrated in the [examples documented with the function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gstat/versions/2.1-2/topics/variogram); one available parameter (`trend.beta`) provides the option of incorporating pre-calculated spatial regressions.

In our example, one could use

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| eval: false
data_sf <- data # sf::st_as_sf(data, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 31370)
sp::coordinates(data_sf) = ~x+y
v <- gstat::variogram(z ~ x + y, data = data_sf)
v.fit <- gstat::fit.variogram(v, gstat::vgm("Mat"))
v.fit
```

**De-trending** just refers to working on the residuals after spatial linear regression.
It is an optional preprocessing step in the context of step 1/**parameter choice**, which can improve the data in a sense that the derived values better match assumptions which are favorable for the following variogram analysis steps.


More details on variogram fitting are available [online, for example on r-spatial](https://r-spatial.org/r/2016/02/14/gstat-variogram-fitting.html).

In preparation of this tutorial, I initially confused setting `sp::coordinates` with the `gstat::variogram` formula `z ~ x + y`, and thought that de-trending is mandatory. 
This is not the case: you can use a `z ~ 1` variogram.
However, the present synthetic data benefits from de-trending ([@sec-nodetrend]).


In my opinion, "de-trending" is not an accurate statistical term. 
What is a trend, where does it start, where does it end?

What they really mean is that the analysis is continued on the residual of a linear regression on all spatial co-ordinates.
In R, we can simply use `lm()`.
The regression formula conatains the outcome variable on the left handside, and all spatial variables (`x`, `y`, sometimes `z`) on the right.


```{r detrending}
#| label: fig-data-detrend
#| fig-cap: "The smoothed data, again, after de-trending."

data$d <- lm(s ~ x + y, data)$residual # "d" as in "de-trending"

# another sunrise...
color <- rbpal(n_observations)[as.numeric(cut(data$d, breaks = n_observations))]
plot(data$x, data$y, col = color, pch = 20,
  xlab = "x", ylab = "y") 

```


::: {.callout-note}
Whether or not to de-trend prior to variogram calculation is a crucial design decision.
De-trending often improves variogram model regression ([@sec-nodetrend]), but it also removes/diminishes the effects of spatially correlated co-variates such as our parameter `a`.

Make sure that you know whether your variogram function applies de-trending, or not.
At any rate, I would recommend to **store the detrended linear effects for later** by applying your own `lm()`, prior to variogramming.
:::


## Beautiful Binning {#sec-binning}

By now, we have prepared several variants of our simulated outcome variables (`z` -> `s` -> `d`), which is more than enough do demonstrate step 1.
The next obvious step is to **cross-calculate distances and differences**, and that is quickly done with the base-R machinery.

It is good to keep track of the difference-distance plot.

The functions `self_difference` and `Euclid_wrap` are defined above ([@sec-crossdifference]).

```{r binning}

# compute raw distance and difference
dist_diff <- data.frame(
  distance = lower_triangle(Euclid_wrap(data)),
  difference_raw = lower_triangle(self_difference(data$z)),
  difference_smooth = lower_triangle(self_difference(data$s)),
  difference = lower_triangle(self_difference(data$d))
)

# limit range, which is a major performance saver.
dist_diff <- dist_diff %>% 
  filter(distance > 0, distance < extent)


# binning, using `cut`
dist_diff$bin1 <- as.factor(
  cut(
    dist_diff$distance,
    breaks = seq(
      0, extent,
      length.out = as.integer(extent/4+1)
    )
  ))
```




I would recommend to *always* look at a raw plot of the difference against distance, before proceeding with any other variogram steps.

```{r difference-distance-plot}
#| eval: true
#| label: fig-difference-distance-ridges
#| fig-cap: "The difference-distance plot, ridgelines (i.e. density distribution)."

dist_diff %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = abs(difference), y = bin1)) +
  geom_density_ridges(rel_min_height = 0.05,
    quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 4,
    scale = 2.0, bandwidth = 0.05) +
  labs(x = "mean absolute difference", y = "distance bin") +
  theme_bw() + coord_flip() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```


This brings us fluently to step 3: **binning by distance**.
Again, a number of choices await.

On real data, it can be beneficial to cut equal-sized bins.
This can be done with the convenient R function `cut_number`.

```{r repeat-binning-equal}
dist_diff$bin <- as.factor(
  cut_number(
      dist_diff$distance,
      n = as.integer(extent)
    ))
```


Note the difference of *equal-sized* (i.e. all bins house the same number of observations) to the more conventional, but maybe less natural *equal-width* (i.e. all bins span the same value range):

```{r equibin-samplesize}
#| label: fig-equibin-sample-size
#| fig-cap: "Sample size per bin for fixed width bins (blue) or fixed sample size bins (turquoise). Consider both for your data set."
b1 <- dist_diff %>%
  summarize("ds" = mean(distance), "n" = n(), .by = bin1)
b2 <- dist_diff %>%
  summarize("ds" = mean(distance), "n" = n(), .by = bin)

ggplot(NULL) +
  geom_step(aes(x = b1$ds, y = b1$n), color = "darkblue") +
  geom_step(aes(x = b2$ds, y = b2$n), color = "turquoise") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "darkgrey") +
  labs(x = "distance (bin average)", y = "samples per bin") +
  theme_bw()
```


On synthedic data, the expected difference in variogram outcome between the two binning methods is negligible.
On real data, it can make a difference:

- A good minimum number of observations per bin should be achieved. Think in the order of a hundred, if your data allows it.
- Fixed distance bin sample size does not generally ramp up as in the synthetic data.
- Bin sample size matters for some difference measures; bins with particularly small or large filling will occur as outliers, especially when calculating semivariance.
- Different sub-categories within the data might be binned separately (e.g. categorical parameter `b`).


::: {callout-note}
Note that bin spacing and size are crucial for variogram calculation.
A substantial minimum number of observations per bin is relevant.
This can be output-driven: do bins align in the form you would like to model, or do they spread a lot with inter-bin noise?

This is not restricted to equally-spaced bins: try log-spacing or equal-size bins!

It might make sense to incorporate categorecal variables into the binning. 
:::


## "Difference" in Distance-Difference Diagrams 

With binning comes the immediate question also part of step 3: 
**what do we actually quantify as "difference"?**


Conventionally, *variance* (VAR) is the average difference of observations (or a subset of observations, e.g. in a group or bin) from the average.
It is implemented in R with the `var` function.
However, applying this formula for variograms is ~~wrong~~ unconventional!

In *variograms*, the mean is replaced by a given point on the landscape (we want to look at differences from that focus point), and then we iterate over adjacent points.
Conventional *variance* and geospatial *semivariance* are related in what is called the "stationary case"; in fact, stationarity is a critical assumption for the following spatial data analyses ([see here](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/extensions/geostatistical-analyst/random-processes-with-dependence.htm)): we assume that

> the mean is constant between samples and is independent of location


Please try to find out yourself what this means.
Personally, I find "constant between samples" a bit fishy: is it "constant between/among two samples" (ridiculous: is it then the mean of those two samples?), or "constant across all samples" (i.e. just "constant everywhere")?
If something is "independent of location", why bother computing a spatial interpolation?
The answer lies somewhere between (among?) the very exact maths hidden in the literature.


And, anyways, if the assumption holds, we get a neat formula for semivariance ["Method-of-Moments Estimator" according to @Cressie1993, p. 69, eqn. 2.4.2], which goes back to @Matheron1962.

We define the **semivariance** $\gamma$:

$\gamma = \frac{1}{2N} \sum\limits_{N} \left(z_j - z_i\right)^2$


Herein, $N$ is the number of observation pairs $\{i, j\}$; those are usually grouped (binned) so to quantify variances at different distances $\gamma\left(h\right)$ (with $h$ the "lag vector magnitude", i.e. distance group).

Semivariance $\gamma$ should better be remembered as **half mean square difference** (HMSD).


There is at least one more option worth attempting: instead of the square-form semivariance above, just calculate **mean absolute difference** (MAD) as follows.

$$ \langle dw\rangle = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i,j} \left| z_j - z_i\right| $$


We will calculate all three parameters for demonstration:
variance, semivariance, and mean absolute difference.


```{r semivariance}

calculate_semivariance <- function (diff_vector) 1/(2*length(diff_vector)) * sum(diff_vector^2) # "HMSD"

dist_diff_binned <- dist_diff %>% 
  select(-bin1) %>% 
  group_by(bin) %>%
  summarize(across(everything(), list(
      "mean" = mean,
      "absmean" = function (measurements) sum(abs(measurements)) / length(measurements),
      "variance" = var,
      "semivariance" = calculate_semivariance,
      "count" = function (measurements) length(measurements)
    )
  )) %>%
  select(bin, distance_mean, distance_count,
    difference_variance, difference_semivariance, difference_absmean
  ) %>%
  rename(c(
    "variance" = difference_variance,
    "semivariance" = difference_semivariance,
    "mean_abs_difference" = difference_absmean
  ))

# semivariance is NOT simply half the variance
dist_diff_binned$half_variance <- 0.5 * dist_diff_binned$variance
knitr::kable(head(dist_diff_binned), digits = 2)
```

As you see from the table, the three measures are slightly different; the difference can become more pronounced on non-synthetic data sets.


::: {callout-note}
No matter whether you choose to use VAR, HSMD, MAD, or anything else,
make sure your readers know what difference you are actually portraying.

Bonus tip: consider standardizing your data prior to calculating differences.
:::


## Eminent Empirics

One more step:

```{r empirical-varigram}
#| label: fig-empirical-variogram
#| fig-cap: "The left panel shows mean absolute difference, whereas the right panel is the semivariance, both plotted against the distance."

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(dist_diff_binned$distance_mean, dist_diff_binned$mean_abs_difference,
   type = "o", col = "darkblue",
   xlab = "distance bin number",
   ylab = "mean absolute difference"
   )
plot(dist_diff_binned$distance_mean, dist_diff_binned$semivariance,
   type = "o", col = "darkgreen",
   xlab = "bin average distance",
   ylab = "semivariance"
   )

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```


You might call these ([@fig-empirical-variogram]) the "empirical variogram", if you like.
They are effectively a variogram. 
Vari-o-gram.
A plot of the bin-wise semivariance (or other difference measures) against distance.


Good to have.
Now let's get started.


# Model Regression {#sec-model-regression}

## Fitting Functions

You might consider all the above as really just preparation for step 4/**modeling**. 
However, (lack of) good preparation is the start and end of any modeling attempt.
There are a lot of combinations and choices by now, and it is worth systematically permuting target parameters and difference measures.


*Cognitive Dissonance Warning:*
because we binned the data above, we now need to fit a function through the bins to interpolate the space in between.
Even more of a paradox is that we will not use that model here to predict any values; it just models semivariance, anyways. 


There are some general convenience wrappers for classical regression in R, though I personally did not find a really convenient one because the shere array of choices is rather intransparent.
However, [base-r `optim` does all we need](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/optim) (*sometimes*).
There are [other libraries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Optimization.html).

We choose between well-known "Nelder-Mead" optimization algorithm [@nelder1965], or the more versatile ["L-BFGS-B"](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html) [@zhu1997; @byrd1995].
They are interchangeable to some degree, yet the latter allows to define logical parameter boundaries to facilitate optimization convergence.


```{r regression-tools}

# wrap a regression function to generate residuals
# the result is the parameter to be minimized.
wrap_target_function <- function(x, y, regressor, parameters) {
  predictions <- regressor(x, parameters)
  differences <- y - predictions

  # optimization superstition: scaling rmse to better read decimals
  differences <- differences * 1000
  return(sqrt(mean(differences^2)))
}

# yet another trick: we can improve model fit on the closer points,
#   by giving them more weight
wrap_target_function_distanceweighted <- function(x, y, regressor, parameters) {
  predictions <- regressor(x, parameters)
  differences <- y - predictions

  # gently improving performance on proximal points:
  differences <- 1000 * differences * 1/sqrt(x)

  rmsd <- sqrt(mean(differences^2))
  return(rmsd)
}


# this can turn regression output into a usable function.
# εὕρηκα, functional programming!
create_prediction_function <- function(regressor, results) {
  fcn <- function (x) {
    regressor(x, results$par)
  }

  return(fcn)
}

# a uniform way to print results
print_regression_results <- function(orsl, label = "") {
  par <- paste(round(orsl$par, 4), collapse = ", ")
  conv <- orsl$convergence
  eps <- orsl$value
  print(sprintf("%s regression: convergence %i at (%s), mse %.1f", label, conv, par, eps))
}

# note: the `epsilon` can be calculated manually with the formula:
#   sum((predictor_function(x) - y)^2)


# Finally, a quick histogram plot of residuals.
plot_residuals_histogram <- function (x, y, predictor_function, ...) {
  residuals <- predictor_function(x) - y
  ggplot(NULL, aes(x = residuals)) +
    geom_histogram(...) +
    theme_bw()
}


```


To test this, behold the non-sensical linear regression!

```{r regression-test}
x <- dist_diff_binned$distance_mean
y <- dist_diff_binned$semivariance

linear_function <- function(x, parameters) {
  return(parameters[1] + parameters[2]*x)
}

optimizer_results <- optim(
  par = c(0, 0.05),
  fn = function(parameters) {
    wrap_target_function(x, y, linear_function, parameters)
  }, method = "Nelder-Mead"
)

print_regression_results(optimizer_results, label = "linear")

```

```{r regression-test-plot}
#| label: fig-linear-regression
#| fig-cap: "In principle, you can fit anything you like to the semivariance."

predictor_function <- create_prediction_function(linear_function, optimizer_results)

ggplot(NULL, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, colour = "black", fill = "white", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = predictor_function(x))) +
  theme_minimal()

```


Observations:

- The regression fits the data more or less well, quantified by the mean square error (`mse`).
- Optimizer did converge (`convergence 0`, [see "convergence" here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/optim.html)), which should not be overrated (the regression might still be irrelevant).
- Parameters can be measured, in this case intercept ($`{r} round(optimizer_results$par[1], 2)`$) and slope ($`{r} round(optimizer_results$par[2], 4)`$).

We can do better, of course.



## Beloved Bellcurve {#sec-gauss}

Quite a popular choice is the **Gaussian**.
There is a suitable "parametric extension" [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function).
It can be slightly simplified, and the terminology adjusted to Variogram slang.


```{r gauss-definition}
#| label: fig-gauss-function
#| fig-cap: "Although it is inverted, scaled, y-shifted, and centered on zero, you will certainly recognize our beloved bell-curve: the Gaussian. Note that we will only use the right half to proceed."

gauss_function <- function(x, parameters) {
  scale <- parameters[1] # height
  mu <- 0 # mean, always zero here
  sigma <- parameters[2] # standard deviation
  nugget <- parameters[3] # height at the zero intercept

  # This parametrization ensures that "nugget < sill" if "scale > 0"
  sill <- scale + nugget

  # the raw, unscaled gaussian kernel
  gauss <- exp(-((x-mu)^2)/(2*sigma^2))

  # the bell should point downwards:
  result <- sill - scale * gauss

  return(result)
}

try_x <- seq(-pi, pi, length.out = 100)
try_y <- gauss_function(try_x, parameters = c(1.5, 1., 0.5))

plot(try_x, try_y, type = "l", xlab = "x", ylab = "y", ylim = c(0, 2.))
abline(v = 0)

```


I still have a hard time to associate anything maths-related to the words `nugget` and `sill`: they could equally well be some ancient greek letters spelled out in a non-greek way, such as `σίγμα`. 
We have to accept that they are frequently encountered in the variogram literature.

- The `nugget` is the value our function takes at the zero intercept, i.e. baseline variance, i.e. the lowest difference we can get (often defined by measurement uncertainty).
- Conversely, the `sill` is the maximum variance we expect to be reached when comparing measurements at totally unrelated locations. The stereotypical Gaussian variogram will asymptotically approach this value towards infinite distance.
- The `sigma` parameter characterizes the width of the curve; it will indicate the range at which measurements still resemble each other to a certain degree.

These parameters will become clearer below when we actually adjust our model to fit the data (i.e. regression).



## Virtuous Variograms

This can be put to action as follows.

```{r regression-matérn}


x <- dist_diff_binned$distance_mean
y <- dist_diff_binned$semivariance # multiplied to support optimizer

start_values <- c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0.) 
optimizer_results <- optim(
  par = start_values,
  lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), # all positive parameters
  upper = c(2*zrange, extent/4, zrange), # prevent crazy outcomes
  fn = function(parameters) {
    wrap_target_function_distanceweighted(x, y, gauss_function, parameters)
  }, 
  control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
  method = "L-BFGS-B" 
)

predictor_function <- create_prediction_function(
  gauss_function,
  optimizer_results
)

print_regression_results(optimizer_results, label = "Gauss")

```

The lower bounds are enabled by our parametrization; the control parameter `fnscale` seems to improve regression accuracy on low-magnitude `y`-values; start values are using our prior knowledge (this is a tutorial, after all, so the regression better work).



Inspecting the residual pattern:

```{r regression-residuals-histogram}
#| label: fig-gauss-residuals
#| fig-cap: "Residual distribution of the Matérn model for semivariance. Reasonably Gaussian as well, with some imagination."
plot_residuals_histogram(x, y, predictor_function,
  bins = 32, fill = "lightgray", color = "black")
```


The regression results for scale, range, and nugget are `{r} paste(round(optimizer_results$par, 2), collapse = ", ")`, respectively.

Conversion to our slightly more meaningful parameters:

```{r range-sill-conversion}
scale <- optimizer_results$par[1]
range <- optimizer_results$par[2]
nugget <- optimizer_results$par[3]
sill <- nugget + scale
```

::: {.callout-note}
The parameter `sigma` here is related to the sigma we used for smoothing above; I chose to define the range as sigma (which is also not conventional).
The sigma | range I see here is the **width of the Gaussian**, which is related, but not equal to what others call `range`.
:::
  

Finally, visualization.
**Behold: a variogram model.**

```{r plot-gauss-variogram}
#| label: fig-gauss-variogram
#| fig-cap: "Variogram of the simulated data, using a Gauss model."

predx <- seq(0, extent, length.out = 2*extent + 1)

ggplot(NULL, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = range, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = nugget, color = "darkgrey") +
  # geom_hline(yintercept = sill, color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, colour = "black", fill = "white", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line(aes(x = predx, y = predictor_function(predx))) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Whenever it works (which should not be taken for granted), the fit is quite good. 
Not perfect here, we can still do better. 


There are certainly much better regression tools, including probabilistic ones which estimate parameter credible intervals.
Please do not hold back to explore these.


# Playground: Taking It Further

## Gentle Generalization

Can we collect all the steps above in a handy function?
Sure!

```{r variogram-function}

fit_variogram <- function(
                   x, y, value, fcn,
                   difference_parameter = c("semivariance", "var", "mad"),
                   skip_detrend = FALSE,
                   verbose = TRUE,
                   ...) {
  # the ellipsis ( , ...) will pass through optimizer parameters

  # convenience structure to match the above
  df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y, z = value)

  # de-trending, optionally disabled
  if (skip_detrend) {
    df$d <- df$z
  } else {
    df$d <- lm(z ~ x + y, df)$residual
  }

  # distance-difference
  dd <- data.frame(
      dist = lower_triangle(Euclid_wrap(df)),
      diff = lower_triangle(self_difference(df$d))
    ) %>%
    filter(dist > 0, dist < extent)

  # binning (could be improved!)
  dd$bin <- as.factor(cut(dd$dist, breaks = as.integer(extent/2)))
  dd_binned <- dd %>% 
    group_by(bin) %>%
    summarize(across(everything(), list(
        "mean" = mean,
        "absmean" = function (vec) sum(abs(vec)) / length(vec),
        "variance" = var,
        "semivariance" = function (vec) 1/(2*length(vec)) * sum(vec^2),
        "count" = function (vec) length(vec)
      )
    )) %>%

  # regression

  optimizer_results <- optim(
    fn = function(parameters) {
      wrap_target_function_distanceweighted(regx, regy, fcn, parameters)
    },
    ...
  )

  if (verbose) print_regression_results(optimizer_results, label = "")

  # store everything in one list;
  # do I sense a smidgen of OOP here? No, not really.
  optimizer_results$fcn <- fcn
  optimizer_results$regx <- regx
  optimizer_results$regy <- regy
  optimizer_results$diffpar <- diffpar

  return(optimizer_results)
}

```

## Matérn Machinery {#sec-matern}

There is at least one step further from Gauss.
Let's mimic what the pro's do!


What follows is an exact quote [(source)](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/articles/model-description.html#gaussian-random-fields).
Note that the $s$ here stants for a position vector, and *not* the smoothed `z`.


`<quote>`

The Matérn defines the covariance $\Phi\left( s_j, s_k\right)$ between spatial locations $s_j$ and $s_k$ as

$$\Phi\left( s_j, s_k\right) = \tau^2 / \Gamma\left(\nu\right) 2^{\nu -1} \left(\kappa d_{jk}\right)^\nu K_\nu\left(\kappa d_{jk}\right)$$
<!-- Φ(sj,sk)=τ2/Γ(ν)2ν−1(κdjk)νKν(κdjk),-->

where $\tau^2$ controls the spatial variance, 
$\nu$ controls the smoothness, 
$\Gamma$ represents the Gamma function, 
$d_{jk}$ represents the distance between locations $s_j$ and $s_k$, 
$K_\nu$ represents the modified Bessel function of the second kind, 
and $\kappa$ represents the decorrelation rate.
The parameter $\nu$ is set to $1$ to take advantage of the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approximation to the GRF 
to greatly increase computational efficiency [@Lindgren2011].
Internally, the parameters $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are converted to range and marginal standard deviation $\sigma$ as 
$$range=\frac{8}{\kappa}$$
and 
$$\sigma=\left(4\pi e^{2log(\tau )+2log(\kappa)}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$


`</quote>`


This is just to confuse you.
I found the $\tau$/$\kappa/$\sigma$-parametrization to be less intuitive and not fitting our geoscience jargon, but the Bessel and Gamma were appropriate; so here a slightly modified parametrization.


```{r matern-definition}

matern_function <- function(d, parameters) {
  scale <- parameters[1] # related to semivariance
  sigma <- parameters[2] # related to actual range; turning point
  nugget <- parameters[3] # minimum difference (at the intercept)
  nu <- parameters[4] # shape parameter

  sill <- scale + nugget
  z <- sqrt(2 * nu) * d / sigma
  K <- suppressWarnings(besselK(z, nu))
  matern <- (z)^nu * K / (2^(nu - 1) * gamma(nu))
  result <- sill - scale * matern
  
  result[is.na(result)] <- 0
  return(result)
}

```

I initially had trouble fitting this function, because I simplified (leaving out `nugget` and `nu`); the version above is quite flexible to fit our variogram.
Note that the function is not defined at zero, which is why I filter `NA`.
Sigma ($\sigma$) is related to the turning point of the Matérn function.
The Matérn implementation does not allow decreasing or oscillating semivariance (sometimes seen in real data), but on the other hand decreasing semivariance would griefly violate Tobler's observation.


Any regression function demands a specific plot function:

```{r matern-visualization}
plot_matern <- function(optimizer_results) {

  # retrieve everything 
  fcn <- optimizer_results$fcn
  regx <- optimizer_results$regx
  regy <- optimizer_results$regy
  diffpar <- optimizer_results$diffpar

  # wrap the function with the optimized parameters
  predictor_function <- create_prediction_function(
    fcn,
    optimizer_results
  )

  # extract parameters
  scale <- optimizer_results$par[1]
  sigma <- optimizer_results$par[2]
  range <- optimizer_results$par[2]
  nugget <- optimizer_results$par[3]
  sill <- scale + nugget


  # plotting
  plotx <- seq(0, extent, length.out = 2*extent + 1)
  plotx <- plotx[plotx>0]
  
  g <- ggplot(NULL, aes(x = regx, y = regy)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept = range, color = "darkgrey") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = nugget, color = "darkgrey") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = sill, color = "darkgrey") +
    geom_point(size = 2.5, colour = "black", fill = "white", alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_line(aes(x = plotx, y = predictor_function(plotx))) +
    labs(
      title = "Matérn regression, with range indicated (vertical line)",
      y = diffpar,
      x = "distance"
      ) +
    theme_minimal()

  return(g)
}


```


In application:


```{r variogram-all}
#| label: fig-alldata-variogram
#| fig-cap: "Variogram of all the data, with a Matérn fit. Warning: the y-axis display range is limited."

vg_all <- fit_variogram(
    x = data$x,
    y = data$y,
    value = data$s,
    fcn = matern_function,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.001),
    upper = c(10, 100, 100, 100),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )
plot_matern(vg_all) # + ylim(0, 0.25)

```

Note the sensible choice of starting values and boundaries. 
Again, I indicated the $\sigma$ range.


See the considerable non-zero nugget?
Let us explore where it comes from!


## Prior Parametrization

To take variogram analysis further, we can filter the dataset to retrieve one of the two `b` categories.
Compare what happens to the range and nugget!

```{r variogram-b0}
#| label: fig-subdata-variogram
#| fig-cap: "Variogram of the sub-data in the `b == 0` category."
semi_data <- data %>%
  filter(b == 0)

vg_b0 <- fit_variogram(
    x = semi_data$x,
    y = semi_data$y,
    value = semi_data$s,
    fcn = matern_function,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.001),
    upper = c(10, 100, 100, 100),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )
plot_matern(vg_b0)


```


```{r variogram-b1}
#| label: fig-subdata-variogram-b1
#| fig-cap: "Variogram of the sub-data in the `b == 1` category."
semi_data <- data %>%
  filter(b == 1)
vg_b1 <- fit_variogram(
    x = semi_data$x,
    y = semi_data$y,
    value = semi_data$s,
    fcn = matern_function,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.001),
    upper = c(10, 100, 100, 100),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )
plot_matern(vg_b1)

```

The $\sigma$-range of the full data set with two different categories mixed is $`{r} round(vg_all$par[2], 1)`$.
If we only include one of the categories, making the data points more similar, ranges are $`{r} round(vg_b0$par[2], 1)`$ and $`{r} round(vg_b1$par[2], 1)`$.
Longer range would mean that distant points are more similar.


The variance itself is also determined by the magnitude of values: 
on the `b==1` subset, we added to the measured parameter. 
Consequently, we see the `scale = sill-nugget` increase from $`{r} round(vg_b0$par[1], 2)`$ to $`{r} round(vg_b1$par[1], 2)`$.

  
If you noticed that especially the `b==0` data does not entirely fit the model, you are right: because of the "wrapped smoothing, then detrending" simulation procedure, the margin prohibits perfect detrending. 
Which brings me to a revision of these effects.


# Recap: De-Trending and Smoothing

*(How does semivariance change without de-trending and un-smoothed, and why?)*

## De-activated De-trending {#sec-nodetrend}

Luckily, we computer-engineerd in a `skip_detrend` flag above.

```{r variogram-nodetrend}
#| label: fig-variogram-nodetrend
#| fig-cap: "Variogram of the data with de-trending disabled."
vg_nodetrend <- fit_variogram(
    x = data$x,
    y = data$y,
    value = data$s,
    fcn = matern_function,
    skip_detrend = TRUE,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.001),
    upper = c(10, 100, 100, 100),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )
plot_matern(vg_nodetrend)

```

Due to the systematic effect in the "trended" data, the semivariance keeps rising with increasing distance,
which the Matérn model shows in a low `nu` and wide `sigma`.
Think about it as standing on a slope: if you look uphill, points tend to be higher, downhill, lower, otherwise points level.
The variance of all points in a fixed circle around you would be much higher, compared to a level field.


Even the inverse seems to be a general pattern:

::: {.callout-note}
If your semivariance keeps linearly increasing, try de-trending your data.
:::

## Skip Smoothing

How about the raw-raw data?

```{r variogram-nosmoothing}
#| label: fig-variogram-rawdata
#| fig-cap: "Variogram of the Non-Tobleronian raw data, i.e. random data without spatial relation."

vg_nosmoothing <- fit_variogram(
    x = data$x,
    y = data$y,
    value = data$z,
    fcn = matern_function,
    skip_detrend = TRUE,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.99),
    upper = c(100, 100, 0.01, 1.01),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )
plot_matern(vg_nosmoothing)
```

As expected, with purely random data, Tobler's law does not apply. 
(The jitter on close points is due to lower sample size.)
As with [Non-Newtonian fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid), these could be called "Non-Tobleronian data".
I had to fix the `nu` and `nugget` because the whole concept does not make sense for a constant.

::: {.callout-note}
If your semivariance returns a constant, your data was not spatially related.

Return to step 1.
:::


# Taking it Further
## MAD Measurements

Conventionally, semivariance is used as a difference measure, yet there are alternatives ([@sec-binning]).


```{r mean-absolute-distance}
#| label: fig-mad-variogram
#| fig-cap: "Is it still a variogram if we do not use semivariance?"

vg_mad <- fit_variogram(
    x = data$x,
    y = data$y,
    value = data$s,
    difference_parameter = "mad",
    fcn = matern_function,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.001),
    upper = c(10, 100, 100, 100),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )
plot_matern(vg_mad)

```

Except for the range of y-values, the regression seems to be similar or better.
In particular, `sigma` is about the same - it better should be, because semivariance as defined above just calculates the square difference.

Feel free to also give variance a try.

::: {.callout-note}
The "square" of differences used to calculate semivariance might be problematic in some situations.


To re-iterate: variogram analysis is a flexible framework.
:::


## Basic Bootstrapping

How certain is the model outcome of our regression?
Bootstrapping might give you a hint.
I much enjoyed [this book chapter](https://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/modchapter.html#bootstrap), which deconstructs the bootstrapping algorithm just like I attempted to deconstruct variogram analysis in this tutorial.


The basic idea:

- repeatedly draw a sample from your data, with replacement
- repeat the whole analysis pipeline and record outcome parameters
- analyze the distribution of model parameters


In code:
I like to have one function which runs the whole procedure and returns a data frame row of the results.

```{r bootstrapping-function}

subset_bootstrap <- function(i){

  # choose a random subset of data rows
  selected_rows <- sample(
    1:nrow(data), 
    # as.integer(nrow(data)), # <- normally, you would reproduce original sample size
    as.integer(nrow(data)/10), # <- for demonstration, I take smaller samples
    replace = TRUE
    )

  # Obtain the bootstrap sample:
  bootstrap_sample <- data[selected_rows,]

  # run the variogram analysis
  optimizer_results <- fit_variogram(
    x = bootstrap_sample$x,
    y = bootstrap_sample$y,
    value = bootstrap_sample$s,
    difference_parameter = "mad",
    verbose = FALSE,
    fcn = matern_function,
    par = c(zrange, smooth_sigma, 0., 1.),
    lower = c(0.0, 0.0, 0., 0.001),
    upper = c(10, 100, 100, 100),
    control = list("fnscale" = 1e-8),
    method = "L-BFGS-B" 
  )

  # collect the results
  strap <- as.data.frame(list(
    "iteration" = i,
    "scale" = optimizer_results$par[1], 
    "sigma" = optimizer_results$par[2], 
    "nugget" = optimizer_results$par[3], 
    "nu" = optimizer_results$par[4], 
    "conv" = optimizer_results$convergence,
    "rmse" = optimizer_results$value
    ))
  return(strap)

}

# print(subset_bootstrap(1)) # test before use
```


The function is free of "side-effects", except that it requires a copy of the `data`, 
and therefore the bootstrapping can be parallelized easily.
Otherwise, just set a high number of iterations, and let it run overnight (writing the outcome to disk).

```{r apply-bootstrapping}
n_iterations <- 2^12

# using the `parallel` toolbox
bootstraps <- bind_rows(mclapply(
    1:n_iterations,
    subset_bootstrap,
    mc.cores = max(c(1, detectCores()-2))
    ))

```


Note that I invalidly reduced bootstrap sample size above, which 
(i) speeds up calculation for demonstration purpose, 
(ii) keeps my RAM from being filled by full copies of the `data` as part of R's parallelization incompetence, 
(iii) changes the data situation because sampling is altered,
(iv) for example leads to regression parameters at the limits, and
(v) is thus not the way to go on real applications. 
You get the point.


Distribution plots are useful, and of course quantiles.

```{r plot-bootstraps}
#| label: fig-bootstrapping_sigma
#| fig-cap: "Bootstrapping results for the `sigma` parameter."

bootstraps %>% 
  filter(conv == 0, sigma < 95) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sigma)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 64, color = "black", fill = "steelblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = smooth_sigma) +
  theme_minimal()
```
  
```{r bootstrap-quantiles}
bootstrap_quantiles <- bootstraps %>%
  filter(conv == 0, sigma < 95) %>% 
  select(-iteration, -conv) %>% 
  reframe(across(
    everything(), 
    function (param) quantile(param, c(0.02, 0.5, 0.98))
  )) %>% 
  mutate(quantile = 100*c(0.02, 0.5, 0.98))
knitr::kable(bootstrap_quantiles, digits = 1)
```

For the majority of bootstraps, the `sigma`-range of spatial coupling falls within the [`{r} paste( round(bootstrap_quantiles[c(1,3), "sigma"], 1), collapse = ", ")`] interval.
This 

:::{.callout-note}
Bootstrapping is a simple and effective procedure to estimate parameter uncertainties.
:::


## Superimposed Scales

One issue I cannot demonstrate on the idealized data of the present tutorial is the issue of **spatial scales**.
On real analysis questions, your geographic range might span multiple (often hierarchical) sub-classes.

Think of site clusters, nested in micro-habitat types, nested in geographically homogeneous areas, overlapping with weather zones... 
The different scales of all those spatial categories we can possibly assign are interwoven in complex ways.


And there might be a logical ground for spatial classifications: observations in homogeneous categories of locations are likely to be more similar among than across clusters. 
Unless you restrict your analysis to a single cluster or cluster type, you will **retrieve influence of all spatial organization levels in your variogram.**
These effects manifest in step-like variograms (in the textbook case), or neverending sloped difference-distance plots much like the "non-detrended" example above, or anything in between.

These effects are more or less subtle if you look at plots of your data at the various steps of variogram analysis.
You could filter or subset your data, or adjust parameter choice by modeling in a "random intercept" for clusters.
With the tools I gave you above, you could even fit a "mulit-Matérn" to stepped variograms, if you desire.


:::{.callout-note}
But first of all, make sure you keep a broad perspective on the specificities of your data set.

# Prospect: Kriging

You might wonder what [kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) ("BLUP" = Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) has to do with all this?

Kriging is a spatial interpolation method, i.e. it can predict values at points in between measured points.
To do so, it requires *prior information* about how data at adjacent locations co-varies.
Look and behold: our variogram procedure above yields exactly that prior.


Why is that the BLUP? 
Well, "Gaussian" is often what we strive for in our error distributions; it is the definition of "unbiased". 
Some other techniques quantify how Gaussian things are to get [independent components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis).
I would argue that there is a bias in science to prefer Gaussian distributions.
You might as well interpolate with the more general [RBF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function) (e.g. [using `scipy.interpolate.RBFInterpolator`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.RBFInterpolator.html)),
without ever plotting such beautiful variograms.


In other fields, kriging might be called "convolution with a Gaussian kernel" (e.g. [image processing](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter.html)).
But in that case, the points are arranged in a regular raster and we call them "pixels" (worth searching for useful image processing routines which you might use for data preparation).
Gaussian convolution can be easily implemented, you can get an idea in the section on "smoothing" ([@sec-smoothing]) above.


You might feel the annoying impudence in my latent mocking of Tobler and Krige and all the great pioneers of the spatial geographical sciences.
Yet I do this on purpose, to motivate you to understand the amazing procedures they established, while keeping an eye out for alternatives.
I would like you look beyond authority to see the pattern: there is no magic in maths (only beauty, if you appreciate it).

Approaching a new mathematical procedure can be fascinating and maybe intimidating.
Until you master it by understanding its less intimidating components.
Computer code can help with that.
No fear of equations!


# Summary

This tutorial provides all the tools you need for your very own variogram analysis.
As demonstrated, the term *variogram* conceals several simple steps, which, when applied by themselves, offer some flexibility for adjustment to specific experimental situations.
Some of that flexibility is summarized in the note-boxes above.


I hope you found the tips useful, and I appreciate feedback, comments, PRs, and additions.
Thank you for reading!
