During this workshop you learn how to turn a regular Rmarkdown file into a bookdown document using the INBO corporate identity. A lot of tips and trics use plain bookdown. So you can use them with other bookdown output formats.

The [slides](https://inbo.github.io/inbomd_examples/inbomd_workshop/inbomd_workshop.pdf) are available on the [INBOmd examples](https://inbo.github.io/inbomd_examples/) website.

The [source code](https://github.com/inbo/inbomd_examples/tree/master/source/inbomd_workshop) is avalaible in the INBOmd example [GitHub repository](https://github.com/inbo/inbomd_examples).
