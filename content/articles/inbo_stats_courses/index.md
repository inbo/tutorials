During the course of the years, we have taught many statistics courses at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO), both for scientists and technicians.
Most of these courses have been developed and taught in-house.
Some (mostly advanced) courses were taught in-house by external teachers.

While we do plan to periodically repeat these courses for new employees and as a refresher, the course material can always be consulted and used for self-teaching or as a reference.

We chose to maintain the links to googledrive folders with the course material on our intranet and therefore limit ourselves here to just point you to that link.
You can find the overview [here](https://sites.google.com/a/inbo.be/intranet/ondersteuning/onderzoek/bmk/lessenreeks-en-tutorials).
This course material is only accessible for INBO employees.

Do note, however, that more recently developed in-house statistics courses will most likely end-up being part of this public website.
An example is the [follow-up INLA workshop](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_inla/).
Moreover, we have several short tutorials on very specific statistical topics.
The best way to find these is to visit the [statistics category](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/categories/statistics/).
